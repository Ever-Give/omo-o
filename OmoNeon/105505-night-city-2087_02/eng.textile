Chapter 2: Why is the restroom gone?

Sorry for the incredibly long wait, I will be posting more regularly from now on.

_________________________

"God damn Ruby, are you peeing on my couch again?"

The woman who had been standing behind the bar just earlier walked up to them, her tone playful yet loud enough to carry over the ambient noise of the bar.

Selene, who had been deep in her own thoughts because of what she saw Ruby do just earlier, jolted slightly in surprise. Her eyes darted from the woman to Ruby, who was looking decidedly more sheepish than before.

“Wait. ‘Again’?” Selene’s eyes widened. “This… wasn’t the first time?”

"Not by a long shot," Vera replied, her voice warm but matter-of-fact. "Thankfully, the couch has self-cleaning tech built into it—and another helper that’s coming right now, saves me a ton of hassle."

As she spoke, a small, whirring robot, no larger than a Roomba, rolled out from under the bar. It silently glided toward the couch, its sleek surface shimmering as it detected the liquid and began cleaning the puddle on the floor with quiet efficiency, leaving no trace behind.

Selene was speechless for a moment before the barmaid extended her hand with a casual grin.

“Hey there, I’m Vera.”

She was pretty, about her age actually, short blond hair with blue coloured extensions and a black leather jacket, and no cybernetic implants that she could see.

Cormac, while taking a puff from his cigar, added, “She’s the owner of The Afterlife.”

Vera nodded at the robot, then turned back to Selene, her smile broadening. "But let’s talk about something more iconic than Ruby wetting herself here at The Afterlife. You see, this bar’s got a tradition—whenever someone becomes a legend in Night City and meets their end, their favourite drink gets immortalized on our menu.

Take Johnny Silverhand or David Martinez, for instance—their signatures are right there behind the bar, etched in neon. It’s our way of keeping their spirits alive, quite literally. Ruby here’s on her way to earning her own, if she keeps up this kind of chaos!"

Selene’s eyes widened; she knew those names, everyone did. The layers of Night City’s culture were sinking in. "So, you’re saying every drink has a story?"

"Exactly," Vera said, her voice carrying a touch of reverence. "Each name on that menu’s a tale of survival, rebellion, or tragedy. It’s not just a drink—it’s a legend. And with Ruby’s antics, who knows? She might just inspire the next one."

Their conversation paused abruptly as a figure stumbled through the crowd, knocking into Vera with a jarring thud. The man didn’t apologize, didn’t even acknowledge the collision, his gaze darting wildly. His eyes were unsettling—unfocused, almost manic, glowing faintly with a strange, erratic light.

In that fleeting moment, Selene and the others caught a glimpse of his cybernetics: metal plating protruding from his arms and neck, jagged and mismatched, as if his body was half-machine, half-madness. His movements were jerky, almost mechanical.

"What the hell, man?!" Vera shouted after him, her voice sharp with frustration, her playful demeanour vanishing as she rubbed her shoulder.

Cormac, exhaling a puff of cigar smoke, frowned, his cybernetic eye glinting in the dim light. "What the hell’s his problem?" he muttered, his tone laced with suspicion. He motioned subtly toward two bulky figures standing near the bar’s entrance—Selene had suspected they were his bodyguards, which was now confirmed to be the case.

"You two, go check on that bastard. Teach him a lesson if he’s asking for it," Cormac ordered, his voice low but firm.

Vera’s eyes widened, her concern cutting through the moment’s tension. "Cormac, I don’t allow violence in my bar," she protested, stepping forward with a protective air.

Cormac waved her off with a dismissive gesture, his cigar trailing smoke. "Relax, Vera. They’ll just have a word with him. No need to escalate... unless he asks for it."

The two bodyguards, clad in dark, reinforced jackets with visible cybernetic enhancements of their own, nodded and moved swiftly, weaving through the crowd toward the back of the bar. The man’s erratic figure disappeared into the shadows, leaving a lingering sense of unease.

Selene shifted uncomfortably, the buzz of the drinks catching up with her as a familiar pressure began to build in her bladder. The alcohol, flowing freely all night, had taken its toll, and the sight of Ruby’s soaked jeans served as both a memory and a warning. She leaned closer to the group, her voice low but tinged with urgency.

"I, uh, need to hit the bathroom. I’m not about to end up like Ruby here," she said, managing a small, nervous laugh.

Ruby grinned, unbothered, while Cormac chuckled, puffing on his cigar. "Where’s the fun in that? But suit yourself, choom." he quipped.

Vera nodded understandingly, waving her toward the back. "Toilets are that way, past the crowd. Watch out for that freak, he went in the same direction."

With a quick nod, Selene stood up, making her way toward the dimly lit hallway leading to the restrooms.

As Selene stepped into the dimly lit hallway, the neon flicker overhead cast eerie shadows on the walls. The air thickened with tension, and a sudden, visceral scream tore through the silence, rooting her in place. Right in front of her, a menacing scene unfolded.

There stood the man from earlier, his mind completely lost to his enhancements. His eyes burned a menacing red, wild with mania. Jagged metal plates protruded from his arms and neck, his body a grotesque blend of flesh and machine, trembling with barely controlled rage. He was intimidating, his presence chilling and predatory.

A cyberpsycho.

The two bodyguards Cormac had sent were outmatched. One lay crumpled on the floor, motionless, his dark jacket torn and bloodied.

As Selene’s heart raced, the other struggled helplessly, pinned against the wall. The cyberpsycho’s arm, where his hand should have been, now extended with a gleaming, serrated blade from his wrist, buried deep into the bodyguard’s chest, blood seeping through the man’s vest, slowly dripping onto the ground beneath him.

Selene’s instincts kicked in, adrenaline surging as the cyberpsycho’s red eyes locked onto her, his manic gaze narrowing with vicious intent. She was his next target now, his trembling frame radiating menace like a malfunctioning death machine. Without hesitation, she activated her Sandevistan. A massive jolt courses through her nervous system.

The world around her slowed to a crawl, the flickering neon lights from the bar dimmed to a sluggish pulse, their colours stretching in hypnotic streaks. The distant thrum of the bar’s music warped into a low, drawn-out drone, and the air thickened, every dust mote hanging lazily in the fog. Even the blood dripping from the injured bodyguard seemed to fall in slow motion.

But Selene moved with an impossible speed, sprinting towards the psycho faster than he could comprehend. Her body a blur of black and silver-green, her petite frame cutting through the hallway, closing the distance in a flash.

Her boots barely whispering against the floor. As she neared the first bodyguard, sprawled and motionless on the ground, she slid onto her knees in a fluid motion, one hand scooping up his dropped gun—a sleek, heavy pistol—in a seamless grab.

She got back up in one motion while taking aim, firing two precise rounds at the cyberpsycho. Sparks erupted as the bullets struck metal, ricocheting off his jagged cybernetic plating with a sharp, metallic screech.

The psycho flinched, his head jerking slightly, but the impact barely slowed him. He roared, swinging his blade-arm in a wide, lethal arc—a motion that, to anyone else, would have been blindingly fast and lethal, but under Selene’s Sandevistan, it was slow and sluggish, the blade slicing through the air in a predictable sweep.

By the time his swing reached its peak, Selene was already behind him, her movements too fast for the cyberpsycho to follow.

She pressed the gun’s barrel against the back of his metal-plated head and pulled the trigger.

A deafening crack echoed in the slowed time, sparks exploding as the bullet tore through metal and synthetic flesh, severing circuits with a sizzling pop.

This would kill any regular human being in an instant, but not this abomination, there wasn’t much humanity left no more. Selene pulled the trigger again and again, unloading the magazine in a rapid, relentless burst.

Sparks flew wildly as each shot hammered into the psycho’s head, his skull a grotesque mix of metal and flesh—did this monster have anything human left in him? The bullets chewed through his cybernetic plating, sending shards of metal and sparks cascading to the floor, until his body finally buckled, collapsing in a heap with a heavy, metallic thud.

As his body hit the ground, Selene disengaged her Sandevistan.

The world snapped back to normal speed in an instant—the neon lights flared, the music roared back to life, and the air rushed in with a sharp, disorienting clarity. Her breath came in ragged gasps.

Selene’s heart pounded wildly, hammering against her ribs, but not from the fight. She’d faced twisted monsters like this before—no, it wasn’t the fight with the psycho that got her riled up.

It was the warm, wet sensation spreading in her crotch, seeping through her panties and into the fabric of her jeans. She glanced down in horror, her breath catching as she saw the wet patch glistening on her crotch, her pee soaking into the fabric of her jeans.

Despite her best efforts to hold on, the Sandevistan had been too much. When she’d activated it, a sharp jolt had surged through her body, a searing electrical current racing along her nerves and muscles, the toll of the implant’s raw power overwhelming her control. Paired with her already full bladder, the strain had pushed her beyond her limits, and now the evidence was visible to the naked eye.

Before the adrenaline could fully fade, a low, insistent beeping sound cut through the haze, confusing Selene as she tried to pinpoint its source. The door at the end of the hallway slammed open—Ruby burst in, her eyes wide with panic, having heard the gunshots.

Scanning the hallway, she spotted the dead cyberpsycho on the ground, the source of the beeping.

"Watch out, Selene! That metal fuck got a built-in self-destruct device!" Ruby yelled.

Selene’s blood ran cold as the realization hit—the cyberpsycho was about to explode any second. Without hesitation, she reactivated her Sandevistan. The world slowed once more, time stretching into a blur. The beeping now a drawn-out drone, and the cyberpsycho’s lifeless form lay on the floor, moments from detonating.

Selene lunged forward, a blur of black and silver-green. She hoisted the dead guy’s heavy, metal-riddled body with a grunt, the weight of his enhancements straining her muscles even under the implant’s power. In a single, fluid motion, she hurled him through the door of the women’s restroom.

She dove away, her body arcing through the air in a desperate roll as the beeping sped up. The explosion erupted with a deafening roar, a fireball tearing through the hallway. Selene was thrown to the ground by the blast, her body slamming into the debris-strewn floor.

Dust and particles filled the air, choking the space, while shards of rubble and the shattered restroom door scattered across the corridor. Selene opened her eyes, trying to regain her senses, her ears ringing from the blast.

Lying on her back, breathless amidst the chaos, Selene felt a warmth—a glowing, spreading sensation in her crotch. The feeling was unexpected, almost intoxicating. It started as a soft, comforting warmth, radiating through her panties and jeans, the warm fabric clinging gently to her skin. The release melted the tension in her body as the warm liquid flowed freely, seeping downward toward her butt. For a fleeting moment, she surrendered to it, the sensation oddly pleasant as she felt much needed relief.

Then, she snapped back to reality. Her eyes snapped open, horror washing over her as she realized she was peeing herself—again, but a lot more this time. With a sharp gasp, she clenched her muscles, halting the stream mid-flow, the warmth lingering on her crotch and butt.

She scrambled to her feet, jumping up in a panic, her heart racing not from the explosion and near-death experience but from the mortification of her unintended act. She could feel the wet fabric clinging to her skin as she got up, the lingering warmth on her butt undeniable.

Selene and Ruby stood there, disoriented. Selene glanced down, realizing that at least the wet patch on her crotch hadn’t expanded much... but then she felt her butt with her hand to assess the damage, already knowing from the fabric clinging to her skin that the back of her jeans was wet. She’d peed enough to leave a wet spot on the ground where she’d been lying amidst the rubble. She was mortified, how could this happen to her, normally she was always so careful?

As the dust settled in the aftermath of the explosion, Ruby picked her way through the rubble, her shoes crunching on debris. She reached Selene, her expression a mix of concern and curiosity as she scanned her for injuries. “You okay, Selene?” she asked, her voice steady but tinged with worry.

Selene, still catching her breath, nodded, her face flushed with embarrassment and adrenaline. But Ruby’s gaze dropped to the wet patch on Selene’s crotch, and she let out a playful laugh. “Wow, looks like you decided to join me and skip the bathroom, eh? Odd choice of timing though!” she teased, her tone light and teasing.

Selene’s cheeks burned, and her voice dropped to a low murmur. “It’s the Sandevistan... it takes a toll on my body when I activate it, makes it hard to hold if I need to pee.... fuck.”

Ruby waved a dismissive hand, her grin widening as she gave her own deliberately damp jeans a playful slap on the butt.

“Relax, it’s not a big deal. Good job on the psycho though—you’ve got some serious guts going one-on-one with this fucker and come out on top.”

Ruby casually kicked a piece lying on the ground, and Selene only then realized it was a metallic shard of the psycho’s arm. The dude was blown to bits... crazy to know that someone would deliberately install such an implant in their own body.

Moments later, the hallway’s entrance filled with curious murmurs as several random patrons from the club gathered, peering into the chaos, drawn by the commotion. Selene felt a wave of vulnerability crash over her, her heart pounding for an entirely new reason. With shaky hands, she shielded the wet patch on her crotch, pressing her back against the wall to hide as much of the evidence of her accident as possible, attempting to merge herself into the shadows.

Cormac entered, his imposing figure cutting through the crowd, his cybernetic eye scanning the destruction.

He stepped further into the hallway, his shoes crunching on rubble, and froze as he saw his fallen bodyguard, lifeless on the ground, blood pooling beneath the torn jacket.

The other bodyguard, groaning and slowly rising, clutched his chest, the wound painful but not life-threatening.

Cormac tossed his cigar aside with a flick of disgust, the glowing ember skittering across the floor.

“Well, fuck,” he muttered, his voice low and gravelly, tinged with a mix of anger and resignation. “Lost one good man tonight, and for what? Some crazed metal fuck tearing up my favourite bar…” He shook his head, his cybernetic eye glinting with a cold, calculated fury.

Vera burst into the hallway, her voice erupting in a loud, drawn-out, and slightly comical “FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!” as she skidded to a stop, her shoes squeaking on the debris-strewn floor.

She scanned the destruction, her eyes locking onto the toilets at the end of the corridor—now a shattered, smoke-filled ruin, the door gone, rubble and twisted metal scattered everywhere.

The hallway was filling with people, drawn by the chaos, their whispers and gasps filling the air. Selene stood frozen, the wet fabric of her jeans clinging to her skin, a constant reminder of her mortification as she stood in wet pants right next to Ruby, whose own jeans were even more wet—but Ruby remained utterly carefree, unbothered by the crowd’s stares or the obvious evidence of her deliberate act from earlier.

Before Selene could process the growing crowd, a sharp, authoritative presence swept into the hallway. Seven figures in bulky, intimidating black tactical gear stormed past, their movements precise and overwhelming.

These were no ordinary enforcers—they were MaxTac officers, Night City’s elite C-SWAT unit, specializing in neutralizing the most dangerous threats the city could produce, including cyberpsychos.

These MaxTac officers were the pinnacle of power, clad in advanced combat armour with full-face helmets that glowed faintly with holographic visors, their designs angular and menacing, reflecting the neon lights in sharp, cold lines.

Their helmets obscured their faces, their cybernetic systems visible through the subtle glow of integrated HUDs.

Each officer bore military-grade weapons—sleek, high-calibre rifles and sidearms, their barrels etched with proprietary Militech or Arasaka tech—and military-grade cybernetic implants that pushed their bodies beyond human limits: reinforced exoskeletons, neural boosters for split-second reflexes, and dermal armour plating that shimmered under the light.

Selene knew them well and had heard plenty of stories; they were basically human war machines.

Their movements synchronized, almost mechanical, a testament to their training and enhancements. Even Selene, with her Sandevistan and combat prowess, knew she was out of her league; she might handle one or two in a pinch, but facing several was a death wish—their combined power made them unstoppable juggernauts, closer to walking arsenals than men.

The officers moved with terrifying efficiency, brushing past Selene, Ruby, Vera, and Cormac without pause, heading straight for the ruins of the restroom, where the cyberpsycho’s remains lay scattered. One of them, taller and broader than the rest, broke off and approached Selene and Ruby, his helmet’s visor glowing an icy blue as he scanned them. His voice, modulated through a speaker, was deep and authoritative. “You two—report. What happened here?”

Selene, still shielding the wet patch on her crotch with shaky hands, felt a flush of relief or perhaps disbelief—he either hadn’t noticed the wet patch on her jeans or chose to ignore it, maintaining a professional demeanour.

Ruby, however, stood unapologetically, her own soaked jeans on full display, her casual posture making it impossible for the officer to miss the evidence of her defiance.

The MaxTac officer’s visor flickered as he listened to their explanation of what had transpired, then nodded approvingly. “Taking down a cyberpsycho one-on-one is no small feat, especially that one. You’ve got guts,” he said, his tone carrying a hint of respect. “We’ve been tracking him since he went on a rampage earlier at a bar down the street. Slaughtered most of the patrons there before we could intervene. He led us here, but you beat us to it.”

And then finally, Vera had had enough.

She threw her hands up and shouted, her voice cutting through the murmurs like a blade, “All right, everyone, that’s enough! Show’s over—bar’s closed! Get the fuck out, now!”

The crowd began to slowly disperse, their curiosity giving way to reluctant compliance as they shuffled toward the exit. As people filed out, the tension in the hallway eased, and Selene felt her racing heart begin to calm, the weight of the chaos lifting slightly. The wet fabric clinging to her skin still gnawed at her, but the thinning crowd offered a small reprieve.

Vera turned to Selene, her expression softening with gratitude. “Thank you, Selene. If it wasn’t for you, this could’ve been a lot worse.”

Before Selene could respond, the MaxTac officer who had spoken to her earlier stepped forward, his modulated voice resonating with authority. “Ms. Vera, we’ll need about an hour or two here. My team’s scraping the remnants together of what’s left from the cyberpsycho—it could take a while longer to secure the scene and collect all the evidence.”

With a curt nod, he turned and joined his colleagues inside the shattered remains of the restroom, their movements precise and methodical as they worked.

Cormac adjusted his jacket and declared, “Enough action for one night. I’m out of here.” He motioned to his injured bodyguard, who grunted painfully but hoisted the lifeless body of his fallen colleague onto his back, staggering toward the exit with grim determination, the weight of loss heavy in his steps.

Turning to Selene, Cormac offered a rare, approving nod, his cybernetic eye glinting. “You’ve got some serious power, Selene. Taking on that psycho one-on-one—impressive as hell.”

Selene, still shaken but grateful for the recognition, managed a small, hesitant smile. “Thanks, but… I’m sorry about your bodyguard. I wish it hadn’t come to this.”

“You don’t need to apologize.” Cormac’s gaze flicked briefly to the wet patch on her crotch, and a wry grin spread across his face. “Looks like you followed Ruby’s lead after all, huh?” he quipped, his voice laced with sarcasm.

Selene rolled her eyes, her cheeks flushing with a mix of embarrassment and exasperation, but she couldn’t suppress a small, reluctant chuckle.

“Oh, before I leave, if you want you can ride with Ruby in a cab, I gave her my premium card you can use if you feel like it.” Cormac added right before he exited the hallway.

Now that Cormac had left, only Ruby, Selene, and Vera remained in the hallway, the MaxTac officers’ work continuing in the background, their authoritative presence lingering.

Vera clapped her hands together, her voice warm but firm. “You two have earned a drink after all this. Follow me—the bar’s closed anyway, and we’re the only ones left.”

They trailed after her, stepping back into the main area of The Afterlife, where the neon lights cast long shadows across the empty bar. Vera moved behind the counter, retrieving a sleek bottle of liqueur—its label glowing faintly with cyberpunk flair—and poured three glasses with practised ease. Sliding the drinks across the bar, she smiled.

“On the house. You’ve both earned it.”

Selene leaned against the bar while she picked up the drink, swirling her liqueur in the glass. “You know, I still need to pee,” she admitted, her voice quieter now, the edge of embarrassment still lingering.

Vera had a playful smirk tugging at her lips. “Oh, I’d gladly point you toward the toilets, but…” She paused dramatically, tapping her chin as if deep in thought, then snapped her fingers. “Oh, right—some freak blew them up! My bad.”

The three women burst into laughter, the sound ringing through the empty bar, the earlier tension melting away in the warm glow of their drinks. Selene shook her head, chuckling. “Guess I’ll just head home after this drink. I’ve got a trek back, and I really want to get out of these wet pants.”

Ruby turned to her, her face blank, almost comically serious, as she pointed out the obvious. “Did you forget you already started earlier in your pants? Why not just finish what you started? No point in holding back now!”

Selene snorted, nearly spilling her drink, her laughter mixing with Ruby’s.

Vera joined in, shaking her head in slight disbelief. “I can’t believe I’m actually siding with Ruby here—she’s got a point, Selene.”

“Also, I can’t quite let you leave just yet!” Vera spoke up while she popped the bottle open again and started pouring their glasses full before they had a chance to be emptied. “I still owe you for what you did.”

Selene took a swig of the glowing liqueur. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, her eyes flicking between Ruby and Vera, who watched her with barely contained amusement, their grins glinting like neon in the dim bar light. “You two are terrible influences, you know that?” she said, her voice laced with mock accusation, though a grin tugged at her lips despite herself.

Ruby leaned forward, resting her chin in her hand, “Terrible? Nah, you’re the one still clinging to some old-world decency in a city that doesn’t give a shit.” She raised her glass. “To freedom, choom—freedom from toilets, from rules, from whatever’s holding you back. Besides, I saw that look on your face back there after the explosion, when you were having your ‘accident’—don’t tell me you didn’t enjoy it!”

Selene’s cheeks flushed hot, her mind snapping back to that moment in the hallway—the sudden flood of warmth, the unexpected relief washing over her, the way her body had surrendered despite her protests. She ducked her head, muttering, “That was an accident, okay? The Sandevistan—it’s like a damn shockwave through my nerves. I didn’t mean to—”

“Sure, sure,” Vera cut in, smirking as she leaned on the bar, topping off Selene’s glass with a flick of her wrist before she could wave it off. “Blame the tech all you want, but you’re still here in wet pants, and the world didn’t end. Speaking of messes, though…” She straightened up, gesturing toward the hallway with a wry grin. “I was planning to renovate that restroom anyway—damn thing’s been falling apart for months. Half-grateful that psycho blew it to bits, saved me the demo costs. Might even slap a new sign up!”

Vera motioned with her hands as if she was holding a sign, “‘Cyberpsychos Can Piss Off’—catchy, right?”

Selene snorted, nearly choking on her drink, while Ruby cackled, slamming her hand on the bar. “Oh, I’d drink to that! Make it neon-pink, Vera, real classy.”

The laughter cracked something open in Selene, the booze buzzing warm in her veins. All things considered she was having a pretty good time, which was odd, she ran into a near dead experience and was sitting here in damp peed pants, and that pressure in her bladder was back just as bad as before... a heavy, insistent ache that pulsed with every sip, but now she was even more aware of it because of the damp fabric clinging to her skin that kept reminding her about her need.

What made the feeling worse was the vivid image of Ruby sitting with spread legs on the sofa, peeing her jeans without a care in the world.

She shifted her weight, crossing her legs tighter while leaning on the bar, but Ruby’s words—and that moment played in her head when she had lost control... no, that moment she was laying on the floor and had enjoyed feeling her warm pee flow... No, she didn’t want to admit it that she was enjoying it while she was going in her pants.

But it kept looping in her head over and over while she her bladder was bursting, she was pretty sure it wasn’t even possible to make it home without having to go find a toilet first...

Maybe it wasn’t such a big deal. Maybe she could just… let go a little. Her jeans already had a big wet patch anyway—what was the harm?

As Vera rambled on about her renovation plans—“Gonna get some Arasaka-grade self-cleaners, tired of mopping up after every drunk edgerunner”

Selene let her grip slacken, just for a moment. A small spurt escaped, a quick dash of warmth blooming in her crotch, seeping into her already-damp panties. She froze, breath hitching, but the sensation was… good—soft and soothing. Quietly, she let out another, longer this time, the warmth spreading through the fabric, a subtle rush that made her bite her lip. The wet patch on her jeans shimmered faintly under the light, growing with each release.

She kept her eyes on her glass, swirling the liqueur, her cheeks burning with shy excitement. Her pants were already a mess—what was a little more?

Another spurt—longer and bolder now, a soothing wave of warmth spread around her crotch, slowly starting to creep down her thighs. It was better each time. The spurts grew bigger, the wet patch darkening steadily, glistening in the bar’s electric glow, and she couldn’t deny it: it was soothing, addictive almost. With each spurt she did she felt less inclined to stop. Meanwhile the wet patch on her crotch had grown significantly by now.

Ruby’s sharp eyes caught the shift, and she grinned, leaning closer. “Feels good feeling the fresh warmth spread into your pants, doesn’t it?”

Selene’s head snapped up, her face flushing deeper, but she couldn’t hide the shy smile tugging at her lips. “Maybe,” she mumbled, voice soft, darting glances between them. Vera paused mid-sentence, noticing the big fresh wet patch on Selene’s jeans, and chuckled, unfazed.

“Don’t be shy about it,” Vera said, pouring another round with a smirk. “No point stopping now—keep going.”

The alcohol was absolutely giving her a helping hand in the decision department, surprised of herself she felt her reservations melt away with the other two’s encouragement, in it’s place she felt a shiver going over her spine in anticipation.

Without hesitation she let out more, feeling her pee stream into her panties and once again inviting the warm glow in her crotch,“Fuck it,” she whispered to herself, instead of stopping again this time she relaxed completely and simply let it happen.

*psssssssss....*

They could hear the soft hissing while the warmth flooded her jeans.

She could feel the warm glow expanding all across her crotch, spreading and soaking through the fabric that started clinging to her skin. The sensation was intoxicating, as the heat cascaded down her thighs, tracing wet trails along her legs, it felt impossibly good, the relieve she felt was melting every ounce of tension she’d been carrying, for a moment she was in bliss.

The idea of stopping or holding back was completely gone as she savoured the sensation, spreading her legs while she let her bladder empty fully in her pants, observing how she was making a puddle on the floor. Her jeans were completely getting saturated from top to bottom by her warm pee, the fabric was glistening in the lights of the bar while her stream started to taper off, her bladder almost empty, she sighted as she pushed out a last spurt. She closed her eyes for a split second, savouring the afterglow, the sheer relief mingling with a strange, giddy pleasure she couldn’t quite name. She almost felt sorry it was already over.

Ruby whooped, raising her glass high. “That’s my girl! Look at you, full send—jeans soaked and a puddle to prove it. How’s it feel?”

Selene grinned, still catching her breath, the booze and the moment swirling together in a dizzy haze. “Like… stupidly good,” she admitted, her voice soft but honest. “Warm, wet, and—fuck, I can’t believe I just pissed myself willingly.” She ran a hand through her hair, glancing down at the drenched mess of her jeans, the wet fabric clinging to her skin. “Guess I’m not going home just yet.”

Selene sat herself down on a barstool, her still dripping jeans making a slight squelching sound as she lowered herself.

“Great idea, stay,” Vera said, topping off their glasses again with a grin. “We’ve got all night, and that bot’s got our backs. No evidence, no problem.”

“Now that you say that,” Ruby spoke up, “Where’s that damn robot anyway?”

Just as Ruby said it the cleaning bot whirred up, rolling in fast and started mopping the puddle with a soft hum, on a mission to make the floor spotless again.

Ruby leaned back, stretching with a satisfied sigh, her own damp jeans on full display as she let her hands caress her still damp thighs. “There we go, see? Told you it feels nice eh?”

"Vera"
