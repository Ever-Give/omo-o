Part 1

Momo, the talented black cat with an uncanny knack for magic, prowled cautiously down the dimly lit hallway of the Magic Academy. The flickering candles on the walls cast long, shifting shadows, and the muffled sound of distant whispers set her fur on edge. Clutched in her paw was her trusted wand, a wooden tool etched with mysterious runes that pulsed faintly in response to her grip. Her emerald eyes scanned the corridor, sharp and alert. Something was wrong tonight—ghosts had invaded the Academy, stealing the ancient spellbook that held powerful incantations. Momo had been tasked with recovering it before the school fell into chaos. As she moved quietly, a faint twinge in her lower belly reminded her of a cup of tea she’d had earlier, but she brushed the sensation aside. "Not now," she muttered to herself. There were bigger problems to tackle.

The hallway ended at the towering library doors, creaking as they opened under her gentle push. Shelves stretched endlessly upward, and the scent of old parchment filled the air. Momo’s ears twitched, sensing movement. Suddenly, with a burst of cold air, a ghostly figure materialized in front of her. Its translucent form wavered as it let out an eerie wail. Without hesitation, Momo steadied her stance, raising her wand. The ghost lunged, and glowing symbols appeared above its head—she had to draw them quickly to fend it off. Momo’s paw moved with precision, tracing the shapes in midair. Sparks flew as her magic collided with the ghost’s energy. The battle stretched on for several tense minutes, her focus unwavering despite the occasional nagging reminder of her bladder.

Finally, with a piercing shriek, the ghost crumpled to the ground, fading into a harmless wisp of mist. Momo let out a sigh of relief, her whiskers twitching with satisfaction. She stood tall, her confidence renewed after the successful skirmish. The library fell silent once more, save for the soft rustling of paper in the drafts. "One down," she thought, her tail flicking as she walked past the defeated specter. Despite the victory, Momo knew this was only the beginning of her perilous journey. Adjusting her satchel, she strode forward into the labyrinthine corridors of the Academy, determined to find the stolen spellbook before it was too late.

Momo’s journey through the Academy brought her to the chemistry lab, a room that seemed far more sinister in the dim light of the night. The faint smell of herbs and chemicals still lingered in the air, and beakers filled with colorful, glowing liquids lined the workstations. She paused briefly to take in her surroundings, her ears twitching at every faint sound. The subtle twinge in her bladder had grown into a nagging discomfort, but Momo shook her head as if to dismiss the thought. There were ghosts to defeat, and she couldn't let herself get distracted. Still, as she adjusted her wand in her paw, her tail flicked nervously, betraying her internal struggle. She muttered, "I can handle this. Focus, Momo."

No sooner had she crossed the threshold into the lab than a swirl of mist coalesced into a larger ghostly figure. This specter was no ordinary ghost—it had an aura of malice, its form flickering as it let out a guttural roar. The air grew colder, and Momo instinctively shifted into a defensive stance, her wand glowing faintly in the dim room. She was ready to fight, or so she thought. As the ghost lunged at her, Momo countered, furiously drawing the runes it demanded. But her movements were slightly less precise than usual, her focus faltering under the dual strain of the battle and her body's growing need. She grit her teeth, frustrated by her own distraction, as the ghost launched an attack that she barely managed to deflect.

The battle stretched on longer than Momo had anticipated. Sweat beaded on her brow as she continued to fend off the ghost’s relentless strikes. Each wave of magic took more effort to counter, and the occasional sharp pang in her abdomen made her wince. “Not now,” she hissed under her breath, willing herself to stay composed. With a burst of determination, she traced the final rune with a flourish. Her wand erupted in a dazzling light, and the ghost shrieked as it disintegrated into nothingness. Momo let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding, lowering her wand as the lab returned to its eerie silence.

For a moment, she stood still, catching her breath and steadying her nerves. The urge she had been suppressing gnawed at her more insistently now, but she brushed it off with a flick of her tail. "I don't have time for this," she muttered, her voice laced with determination. Adjusting the strap of her satchel, she pushed forward, her pawsteps echoing against the tiled floor. There was no room for hesitation; the spellbook and the safety of the Academy depended on her success. Ignoring her growing discomfort, Momo pressed on into the dark hallways ahead, knowing the next challenge awaited her.

Momo’s pawsteps echoed softly as she approached the physics classroom, the air in the hallway growing heavier with every step. Her bladder now felt undeniably full, the discomfort steadily intensifying into a distracting pressure. She paused briefly at the door, shifting her weight between her paws, trying to steel herself for the challenge ahead. “No time for this,” she whispered, her voice tinged with a mix of frustration and determination. The mission came first. With a quick push, the door creaked open to reveal the familiar room filled with globes, pendulums, and towering orreries. The stillness was unnerving, broken only by the faint ticking of an old clock in the corner. Momo tightened her grip on her wand, her tail curling with tension.

Suddenly, a cold gust of air swept through the room, extinguishing the single flickering candle that had provided her with light. From the center of the room, a swirling mist began to gather, its glow faintly resembling the night sky. The Planetarium Ghost appeared in all its spectral glory, its translucent form dotted with glowing stars that orbited its core. Momo felt a shiver race down her spine. She knew this ghost all too well; from her practice simulations, she remembered how unpredictable its attacks could be. It was almost inevitable she would take a hit or two—and she could only afford three before her body betrayed her completely. A cold sweat broke out on her brow as the ghost let out a low, rumbling growl, and the battle began.

The ghost moved quickly, hurling glowing celestial orbs toward her with relentless speed. Momo darted to the side, dodging the first wave, and raised her wand to counter. The glowing symbols above its head flickered rapidly, forcing her to trace them at a breakneck pace. Her paw moved swiftly, but her growing desperation made her movements less steady. One orb grazed her side, and she let out a small yelp as the impact knocked her off balance for a moment. Gritting her teeth, she refocused, ignoring the sharp pang from her abdomen. "Not now, not now," she muttered through clenched teeth, her ears flattening as she fought to regain control. Another wave of attacks came, and though she managed to block most of them, a second hit struck her. The impact sent a jolt through her, and she faltered, pressing one paw instinctively between her legs as she steadied herself.

With one hit left before things went disastrously wrong, Momo summoned every ounce of focus she had left. Her wand glowed brightly as she traced the final sequence of runes. A powerful burst of light erupted from her wand, enveloping the ghost in its radiance. The Planetarium Ghost let out a piercing shriek before dissipating into stardust. The room fell silent once more, save for the soft ticking of the clock. Momo staggered slightly, breathing heavily, her legs trembling as she pressed her paw against her middle for a moment. She had survived, but just barely.

As the adrenaline began to fade, Momo moved slowly toward the exit, one paw still pressed discreetly between her legs. She couldn’t risk losing control now; there was still so much left to do. Each step felt deliberate, her focus split between keeping her composure and preparing for the next battle. "I can do this," she whispered, her voice shaky but resolute. Taking a deep breath, she pushed the door open and ventured into the next hallway, the weight of her mission—and her growing desperation—pressing heavily on her.

The gymnasium loomed before Momo, its wide double doors slightly ajar as if inviting her into the next challenge. She hesitated for a moment, her breathing shallow as the weight of her desperation pressed harder. Her bladder was no longer an ignorable annoyance—it was a constant, urgent reminder that she was pushing her limits. She winced, shifting her stance to ease the pressure, then shook her head determinedly. There was no time for weakness now. The stolen spellbook was still out there, and every delay gave the ghosts more opportunity to wreak havoc. Clutching her wand tightly, she pushed open the doors and stepped inside.

The gymnasium’s once familiar walls now felt ominous under the dim glow of floating lanterns. The faint scent of dust and polished wood filled the air. From the far end of the room, a towering specter emerged: the Coach Ghost. It wore a tattered whistle around its neck and gripped a spectral clipboard that pulsed with a menacing energy. Momo knew this ghost all too well. Its strategy was as intimidating as its appearance—while it advanced with deliberate, threatening strides, minion ghosts would swarm her from all sides. If she let the Coach get too close, a swipe from its clipboard would send her sprawling, and in her current state, she couldn’t afford such a mistake.

The battle began abruptly. Minion ghosts poured in from every corner, their eerie shrieks echoing through the gymnasium. Momo spun into action, her wand glowing brightly as she traced symbols in rapid succession. The ghosts came at her relentlessly, each one requiring her full attention to banish. Meanwhile, the Coach Ghost loomed ever closer, its heavy footfalls reverberating through the floor. Momo’s movements grew more frantic as she fought to keep up with the barrage of attacks, all while the growing tension in her abdomen made her steps feel heavier and her focus waver. A sharp pang forced her to pause for a split second, and she stumbled, her knees buckling slightly. “No, no, no,” she muttered under her breath, pushing herself upright as another wave of minions descended.

Her paw worked furiously, her movements a blur as she dispatched the last of the minions. The Coach Ghost was nearly upon her now, its glowing clipboard raised high. Summoning every ounce of her strength, Momo traced the final symbol with a desperate flourish. A burst of light exploded from her wand, sending the Coach Ghost reeling back with a bellow of frustration. It crumbled into wisps of ectoplasm, leaving the gymnasium silent once more. Momo stood frozen for a moment, panting heavily, before collapsing onto all fours. Her wand clattered to the floor as she focused every fiber of her being on maintaining her composure. Sweat dripped from her brow, and her tail curled tightly around her body as she fought back the threatening tide within her.

For a moment, the thought of giving in and relieving herself right then and there was almost overwhelming. She glanced around the gymnasium, considering the empty corners, the safety of the shadows. But another image forced itself into her mind: Marshmallow, the ghost who had stolen the spellbook. That mischievous specter was the reason for all of this chaos, and it was likely holed up in the final room. She couldn’t waste time now, not when the fate of the Academy was still in the balance. With a reluctant sigh, Momo pushed herself to her feet, her legs trembling slightly as she steadied herself. “Just a little longer,” she whispered, her voice tinged with resolve and exhaustion. Adjusting her robe carefully, she turned toward the next hallway, determined to finish what she had started.

Momo stepped onto the Academy’s wide, open balcony, the cool night air rushing past her as she emerged. The stars above twinkled serenely, a sharp contrast to the chaos brewing below. There, floating above the parapet, was Marshmallow—the mischief-maker who had stolen the spellbook and thrown the entire school into turmoil. The ghost’s translucent form shimmered with an otherworldly glow as it sneered down at her, its single visible eye glinting with amusement. "You’ve come all this way," Marshmallow taunted, his voice echoing with a mocking lilt. "But you’re too late, little kitten. Care to try your luck?" Momo bristled at the insult but said nothing, her gaze steely. Her paw tightened around her wand as she climbed onto her broomstick, her movements careful, the strain on her body now impossible to ignore.

With a swift kick, Momo launched into the air, the balcony quickly receding below her. The cold wind bit at her fur as she ascended, her broomstick trembling slightly under the weight of her mounting tension. Marshmallow began to chant, his voice growing deeper and more guttural with each word. The air around him crackled ominously, and his form began to distort and swell. Momo watched, her breath hitching as the playful ghost transformed into a hulking, three-eyed monstrosity. Its new form radiated menace, its extra eyes glaring at her with a predatory gleam. She gulped quietly, clutching her broomstick tightly. "Just focus," she told herself, though the knot in her stomach was now equal parts urgency and dread.

The battle began with a deafening roar as Marshmallow hurled orbs of dark energy toward her. Momo darted through the air, dodging and weaving as the projectiles exploded around her, sending shockwaves that rattled her broomstick. Sweat beaded on her forehead as she concentrated, her wand glowing faintly. The key to defeating Marshmallow lay in the lightning spell, a high-powered incantation that required near-perfect precision. Normally, she could manage it with ease, but now, with her bladder screaming for attention, it took all her willpower to focus. Each time she traced the necessary symbols, her paw shook slightly, and her breath came in short, shallow bursts. Her tail twitched nervously as she fought to ignore the pressure that had become impossible to fully suppress.

Marshmallow lunged at her, forcing Momo to swerve sharply to avoid him. The sudden movement sent a jolt through her body, and she let out a small gasp, her composure faltering for a split second. “Not now,” she whispered through gritted teeth, her focus narrowing to the glowing runes before her. With a desperate burst of determination, she completed the spell, unleashing a bolt of crackling lightning that struck Marshmallow square in the chest. The massive ghost howled in pain, his form flickering and shrinking as the energy coursed through him. Again and again, Momo repeated the spell, her movements growing more frantic as the battle wore on. Finally, with one last devastating strike, Marshmallow let out a final wail before disintegrating into a cloud of harmless mist.

Panting heavily, Momo hovered in the air for a moment, her wand trembling in her paw. The spellbook lay below her on the balcony, its glowing cover a welcome sight. She wasted no time, swooping down to retrieve it and clutching it tightly to her chest. But there was no time to celebrate. The battle had pushed her to her limits, and the urgency she had been suppressing was now impossible to ignore. With a hurried stride, she bolted back inside, her heart pounding in her chest. Her paw pressed against her middle as she moved as quickly as her trembling legs would allow. The corridors seemed impossibly long as she raced to find relief, her focus now singular: she needed to get to safety before it was too late.

Momo rushed through the dim hallways, her paws echoing against the stone floors as her heart pounded in her chest. The spellbook was safely tucked into her satchel, but her thoughts were entirely consumed by a far more pressing matter. Every bathroom she had passed earlier was out of order, damaged by the chaos of the ghost invasion. That left only one option: the nearest functional restroom back in the library. Her tail flicked anxiously as she ran, each step sending jolts through her already strained body.

When she reached the physics classroom, the strain finally caught up to her. She skidded to a stop, clutching at her middle as a sharp pang forced her to pause. A small, warm spurt escaped before she could stop it, and her cheeks flushed beneath her fur. She clenched her legs together tightly, whispering, "No, no, no!" She took a shaky breath, regaining her composure, and pressed onward. Her movements were now more frantic, her paws trembling as she pushed herself to move faster. The library door loomed ahead, a beacon of hope. She reached out, grabbing the handle and pushing it open.

Ending 1

As the door swung open, Momo darted inside, her eyes scanning desperately for the restroom at the far corner of the library. She sprinted the last stretch, every step feeling like an eternity. Bursting through the door, she locked it behind her, her paws fumbling to remove her robe. With mere seconds to spare, she perched on the edge of the toilet, sighing in immense relief as she finally let go. The tension drained from her body as she slumped back, her tail flicking lazily behind her. "That... was too close," she muttered, her voice trembling with equal parts exhaustion and relief. Despite the chaos of the night, she couldn’t help but smile at her small victory.

Ending 2

As the door swung open, Momo bolted into the library, her goal only a few steps away. But the exertion and the mounting pressure became too much to bear. Just as she reached for the restroom door, her body gave in. Warmth spread beneath her robe, and she froze, her heart sinking as she realized what had happened. Her ears flattened in embarrassment as she shifted awkwardly, her tail curling tightly around her leg. She glanced around the empty library, grateful no one was there to see her moment of defeat. "Well," she sighed softly, forcing a small, rueful smile, "at least the ghosts didn’t win this one." She straightened up, determined to clean herself up and carry on. Even in the face of mishaps, Momo was never one to give up.

Part 2

The morning sun shimmered across the endless ocean, its golden light dancing on the waves. Momo stood on the balcony of the Magic Academy, her paws resting gently on the stone railing as she admired the serene beauty before her. The salty breeze ruffled her fur, and for a moment, she allowed herself to forget the chaos of the previous night. The spellbook was safely returned, and the Academy had been restored to peace. She sighed contentedly, her tail flicking lazily behind her. But as her gaze swept across the horizon, something caught her eye—a faint, ghostly face rippling beneath the surface of the water.

Her ears perked up, and she leaned closer, squinting to make out the figure. Her heart skipped a beat when recognition struck: it was Marshmallow, the mischievous ghost she had defeated just hours ago. "Impossible," she whispered, her whiskers twitching with unease. She was certain her final spell had banished him entirely. Yet there he was, grinning up at her from beneath the waves. Momo’s tail bristled as she stood upright, shaking off the eerie image. “If he’s back, I’ll deal with him—again,” she muttered, her determination outweighing her confusion.

With a flick of her wand, Momo cast a powerful spell, surrounding herself with a shimmering aura. The magic would allow her to breathe underwater indefinitely, freeing her from any distractions while she investigated. Adjusting her satchel and wand, she leapt gracefully from the balcony, diving into the cool embrace of the ocean below. The water was clear and vibrant, teeming with schools of shimmering fish and sprawling coral reefs. She swam with ease, her magical aura illuminating the depths as she descended further.

Not long after, she spotted the first wave of ghosts—small, glowing apparitions darting between the kelp forests. They carried strange, flickering flames in their translucent hands. Momo’s eyes narrowed; these soul flames weren’t theirs to take. She swam closer, her wand at the ready. Yet as she prepared to engage them, a faint twinge in her lower abdomen caught her attention. It wasn’t urgent, just a subtle discomfort that made her pause for a moment. She quickly dismissed it with a flick of her tail. “Focus, Momo,” she reminded herself, her voice firm. There was no time for distractions—not when Marshmallow might be behind this new ghostly mischief.

Determined, she pushed onward, following the trail of soul flames deeper into the ocean’s vast expanse. The water grew darker and colder as she descended, but her resolve remained steady. Whatever lay ahead, she was ready to face it.

The Sunlight Zone greeted Momo with a breathtaking display of life and color. Coral towers reached upward like vibrant cathedrals, and schools of fish shimmered in hues of gold, blue, and silver as they darted around her. The soul flames that the ghosts had stolen flickered in the distance, their ethereal glow stark against the otherwise peaceful seascape. Momo wasted no time; her wand pulsed in her paw as she banished the small ghosts one by one. Each burst of light from her spells sent a ripple through the water, scattering the fish but clearing the area of its spectral invaders.

Just as she exhaled in satisfaction, her gaze fell upon a strange, pulsating figure gliding through the water. It was an Immortal Jellyfish—its delicate, translucent bell and trailing tentacles glowing faintly in the deep. But something was wrong. The jellyfish’s movements were jerky and unnatural, and a dark, ghostly aura surrounded it. Momo’s eyes narrowed. The creature had been possessed. The sight made her fur bristle; she couldn’t allow the ghost to torment such a harmless being.

Steeling herself, Momo approached cautiously. The jellyfish recoiled, sensing her presence, and began to dart erratically through the water. The ghost inside it lashed out with bursts of dark energy, forcing her to dodge and counter with precise spells. The water shimmered with flashes of magic as the battle dragged on, the jellyfish’s erratic movements making it difficult to focus on the ghost. Momo’s paw moved with determination, tracing intricate runes to weaken the ghost’s hold. It took longer than she had anticipated, but with one final burst of light, the ghost was expelled, disintegrating into harmless wisps. The jellyfish, now free, glided away gracefully, its natural rhythm restored.

Momo watched it disappear into the depths, a small smile tugging at her lips. “One problem solved,” she muttered, adjusting her grip on her wand. But as she prepared to move on, a wave of pressure made her pause briefly. The faint twinge in her bladder had grown more noticeable, a subtle but persistent reminder of her earlier tea. She shifted uncomfortably, her tail curling instinctively, but she quickly pushed the thought aside. There was still so much to do, and dwelling on it wouldn’t help.

With a flick of her tail, Momo resumed her descent. The water grew darker, the vibrant hues of the Sunlight Zone fading into murky blues as she ventured deeper. She kept her focus sharp, scanning the water for signs of more ghosts as the stolen soul flames led her ever downward. Whatever awaited her in the depths, she would face it head-on—no matter the growing distractions.

The water grew dimmer as Momo descended into the Twilight Zone, the Sunlight Zone’s vibrant colors now replaced with muted blues and grays. Bioluminescent creatures glowed faintly in the murk, their soft lights casting eerie shadows that danced across the seabed. Momo’s paw tightened on her wand as she swam deeper, the soul flames flickering faintly in the distance. The weight of the ocean above her and the growing stillness of her surroundings made her fur bristle slightly, but she pressed on with determination. As she moved cautiously forward, a flicker of movement caught her attention—a school of fish darting toward her.

At first, the fish seemed harmless, their silvery scales catching the faint light. But as they swam closer, Momo noticed something odd about their movements. Their eyes glowed an unnatural, ghostly blue, and their bodies shimmered with the telltale aura of possession. She frowned, readying her wand. The name of the species tickled her memory, and she muttered to herself, “Boops... Boops? Is that really what they’re called?” She shook her head, dismissing the thought as unimportant. The possessed fish were behaving strangely, clustering together in a tight formation, their mass shifting and twisting in the water to appear larger and more menacing.

Momo realized she wasn’t just dealing with a single ghost; this was a collective entity manipulating the fish to intimidate her. The "boss" floated before her, a writhing mass of glinting scales and glowing eyes. She darted to the side as it lunged toward her, narrowly avoiding a collision. Her mind raced as she recalled her spells. The only way to break their formation was the lightning spell—a difficult but effective incantation that would safely disrupt the ghostly energy without harming the fish.

With a flick of her wrist, she began tracing the intricate rune for lightning, her paw moving with practiced precision. Sparks crackled from her wand as the spell took form, sending a surge of energy streaking through the water. The light was blinding, illuminating the dark zone in a brilliant flash. The mass of fish scattered instantly, their glowing eyes returning to normal as the ghost’s hold was broken. The disembodied specters let out a shriek before dissipating into harmless wisps.

Momo let out a sigh of relief, lowering her wand as she floated in place for a moment. Her breathing was steady, but the faint strain of the battle weighed on her. A persistent ache in her abdomen made her grimace briefly—her bladder now reminding her more insistently of its fullness. She shifted slightly, placing a paw against her middle, but quickly shook off the thought. "Later," she muttered, trying to focus on the task at hand.

Adjusting her satchel, she swam downward into the Midnight Zone. The water grew colder, and the light from the surface all but disappeared, leaving her surrounded by an oppressive darkness broken only by the faint glow of bioluminescent creatures. The stolen soul flames burned faintly in the distance, guiding her deeper into the abyss—and closer to whatever final challenge awaited her.

As Momo descended into the Midnight Zone, the ocean around her transformed into an impenetrable void of darkness. Only the faint bioluminescence of strange deep-sea creatures and the flickering soul flames provided any semblance of light. The water was icy and oppressive, pressing heavily against her as she swam deeper. She knew this zone was notorious for its dangers, especially the elusive and infamous Vampire Squid. The thought of encountering one possessed by a ghost made her fur bristle. She glanced down at her wand, the soft glow of its runes barely cutting through the gloom. If a Vampire Squid was under ghostly control, she would need to tread carefully; its speed and unpredictable movements would make it a formidable opponent, especially in the suffocating dark.

The chill in the water wasn’t the only thing making Momo uneasy. Her bladder was now a constant source of discomfort, the pressure growing steadily as she pushed herself further into the depths. She paused for a moment, floating in the still water, her tail swaying slightly as she tried to catch her breath. The ache was sharper now, forcing her to press a paw gently against her abdomen. She winced but quickly shook her head. “Not now,” she muttered under her breath, her tone more pleading than commanding. She couldn’t afford to lose focus—not here, not when the stolen soul flames were so close.

Her worst fears were realized when a shadow flickered in the distance. The shape moved with an eerie grace, its wide, webbed arms fanning out like a cloak. Momo’s eyes widened as the Vampire Squid emerged from the darkness, its translucent body glowing faintly with an ominous green hue. It had been possessed, its movements erratic and unnaturally aggressive. The creature swam toward her with terrifying speed, its luminous eyes fixed on her like twin spotlights. Momo tensed, gripping her wand tightly.

The battle was immediate and relentless. The Vampire Squid darted through the water, its webbed arms flaring out to intimidate her as it launched bolts of ghostly energy. Momo twisted and turned, narrowly dodging the attacks, her tail whipping behind her. She raised her wand, tracing symbols frantically as the squid closed in. A well-timed spell struck the creature, forcing it to recoil, but the effort left her panting. The pressure in her bladder surged painfully with every sudden movement, threatening to break her concentration.

One attack grazed her side, sending a jolt of pain through her. "Two hits left," she thought grimly, her ears flattening as she steadied herself. She retaliated with another burst of magic, the light illuminating the abyss momentarily. The squid flared its arms again, surging toward her with terrifying speed. Another hit clipped her leg, and she bit back a gasp, her body trembling as she fought to maintain control. "Just one more," she whispered, desperation clear in her voice as she focused on the final rune.

With a burst of determination, Momo unleashed her strongest spell, the light piercing through the dark waters and striking the Vampire Squid squarely. The ghostly aura around the creature dissipated, and the squid retreated into the shadows, its movements calm and natural once more. Momo hovered in place, her paw clutching her abdomen as she breathed heavily. The battle had pushed her to her limits, and she could feel the strain in every part of her body.

Taking a moment to compose herself, she adjusted her satchel and steadied her grip on her wand. The Abyss awaited her—the deepest and most treacherous part of her journey. With the soul flames still flickering faintly in the distance, she willed herself onward, her resolve unwavering despite her mounting exhaustion and desperation.

The Abyss stretched before Momo, an expanse of near-total darkness. The only lights came from the faint glow of soul flames flickering far below and the eerie bioluminescence of creatures she couldn’t begin to identify. The cold here was bone-deep, and the water felt heavier, pressing against her body like an invisible force trying to hold her back. As she swam further down, a structure began to take shape in the murk—a ship, fully intact, resting serenely on the ocean floor. Its surface was strangely pristine, untouched by the ravages of time or water. Momo’s curiosity sparked, and she approached cautiously, her tail swishing behind her.

The ship’s design was elegant, its wood gleaming faintly despite the lack of light. A flicker of hope rose in Momo’s chest. Perhaps someone—or something—aboard could help her. With a firm grip on her wand, she swam through the open doors, her paws brushing against the smooth, cold wood. Inside, the air—if it could even be called that—felt heavy with an unnatural stillness. Her fur stood on end as the shadows seemed to shift and ripple. It didn’t take long for the ghosts to appear. They materialized from the walls, their translucent forms swirling menacingly around her. Momo readied herself, tracing runes with quick, fluid motions as she banished them one by one.

As the last ghost dissipated, Momo noticed a faint light glowing above her. She swam toward it, her eyes narrowing as she spotted the runes hovering around a spherical object. It was unlike anything she had encountered before—a round, glassy orb that pulsed gently with energy. Intrigued, she reached out and began tracing the runes around it. The symbols were complex, but her practiced paw moved with ease, until the glowing runes suddenly multiplied into a long sequence of twenty. Her heart sank as realization dawned on her. “No,” she whispered, her ears flattening against her head. This was just like the simulations.

A shiver ran down her spine as she turned slowly, her wand trembling in her paw. Behind her, a massive, glowing form emerged from the shadows. The possessed Anglerfish loomed, its jagged teeth and glowing lure casting an ominous light across the wreck. Its movements were deliberate and slow, much slower than in the simulations, as if it were testing her resolve—or taunting her. Momo’s breath hitched as she steadied herself. She had no choice but to fight.

The battle was tense and grueling. The Anglerfish’s movements were deceptive, its slow approach interspersed with sudden bursts of speed that forced Momo to dodge frantically. Each spell she cast felt like a marathon, the effort compounded by the strain on her body. Her bladder ached with every twist and turn, every sharp movement sending a pang through her abdomen. She gritted her teeth, pressing a paw against her middle briefly before refocusing on the runes. Slowly but surely, she whittled down the ghost’s hold on the creature.

With a final burst of light, the Anglerfish let out a bone-chilling shriek, the ghostly aura shattering as it swam away into the darkness, free from its possession. Momo hovered in place, panting heavily as her body trembled from the exertion. Her paw pressed firmly against her abdomen as she tried to regain her composure, the pressure in her bladder now impossible to ignore. She glanced downward, the soul flames still glowing faintly far below, marking her next destination: The Trenches.

Before she could move, a sudden creak echoed through the ship. From behind the wheel, a figure appeared—a mercat with a sturdy build and a captain’s hat tilted jauntily on her head. “Captain Sugar,” the mercat introduced herself, her voice warm but commanding. She swam to the wheel and grasped it confidently, signaling Momo to follow. “You’ve done well, little witch,” Sugar said with a sly smile. “But the hardest part’s ahead. Let’s finish this together.”

Momo nodded, her determination outweighing her exhaustion as she readied her wand. The final battle awaited her. Somewhere in the depths of The Trenches, Marshmallow—the cunning ghost she had already bested once—was waiting.

The darkness of The Trenches was oppressive, thicker and colder than anything Momo had encountered so far. The water felt almost alive with tension, pressing heavily against her fur as she swam downward alongside Captain Sugar’s ship. The glow of the stolen soul flames had grown brighter, but what lay ahead filled Momo with dread. In the distance, she spotted an ominous, glowing shape in the seabed, its edges pulsating faintly like the rim of an underwater volcano. As she drew closer, the shape took form—Marshmallow’s face, grinning up at her with eerie confidence. The ghost’s mocking laughter echoed through the water, sending a shiver down Momo’s spine.

“Well, well,” Marshmallow sneered, his voice dripping with smugness. “If it isn’t my favorite little witch. Tell me, how did you fare in the simulations? Oh, that’s right. You couldn’t beat them flawlessly.” His glowing eyes locked onto hers, and his grin widened. “And yet, here you are, thinking you can handle me. You don’t stand a chance—not like this.”

Momo’s stomach churned, a mix of frustration and apprehension washing over her. She had never been able to best Marshmallow in the practice simulations without taking at least three hits, and the thought of needing to defeat him flawlessly now seemed impossible. Her paw clenched tightly around her wand as she steadied herself. “I’ve come this far,” she whispered under her breath, her determination burning despite the knot of anxiety in her chest. Her tail flicked sharply as she took her place in front of the volcanic battlefield.

The fight began with a thunderous roar, the ground shaking as Marshmallow’s form erupted from the seabed like molten lava. Glowing prompts appeared around him, first in sets of fifteen, then twenty, twenty-five, and finally thirty. The runes flashed in rapid succession, demanding Momo’s absolute focus and precision. Her paw moved faster than ever before, tracing each symbol with desperate accuracy. Marshmallow hurled waves of ghostly energy toward her, his attacks growing fiercer and faster with each passing moment.

The strain was immense. Momo’s body screamed with exhaustion, her paws trembling as she fought to keep up. Her bladder throbbed with each frantic movement, the pressure mounting unbearably as she dodged and countered. But she didn’t dare falter—not here, not now. Gritting her teeth, she pushed through the pain, tracing the final, intricate sequence of runes with a burst of adrenaline.

With a deafening wail, Marshmallow’s form began to disintegrate, his glowing eyes dimming as he was banished once more into nothingness. The battlefield fell silent, save for the soft hum of the soul flames as they returned to their rightful place. Momo hovered in place, panting heavily, her body trembling from the exertion. She wanted to collapse right then and there, but Captain Sugar’s voice snapped her back to reality.

“Up we go, witch,” the mercat said, spinning the ship’s wheel. The vessel glowed brightly, its magic lifting them from the ocean floor. They ascended quickly, the water growing lighter as they breached the surface and soared into the air. Momo clutched the edge of the ship, the cool breeze rushing past her fur as they glided back toward the Academy.

As they neared the balcony, the ship slowed, allowing Momo to leap onto solid ground. She landed with a soft thud, steadying herself just before her legs buckled. The strain of the battle, both physical and mental, now weighed on her heavily. Her paws pressed instinctively against her middle as she straightened up, remembering the stress she had endured—and the limits she was quickly approaching. Without wasting another second, Momo bolted for the doors, rushing back inside the Academy. She had survived the depths, but her most urgent challenge was now just moments away.

Momo darted through the Academy’s halls, her wet paws leaving faint prints on the stone floors. Her heart pounded, but this time it wasn’t from battling ghosts or tracing runes. The strain of the last fight—and the weight of everything she had endured—had pushed her to her limits. The urgency she had been suppressing all day now consumed her thoughts, each step sending sharp reminders of just how close she was to her breaking point. The nearest bathroom was on the far side of the library.

As she rounded a corner, a sharp pang made her gasp softly. She froze for a moment, clenching her legs tightly together, willing herself to regain control. “Just a little further,” she whispered, her voice shaky. She forced herself forward, every step more deliberate than the last. The library doors loomed ahead, and she reached out to push them open. Inside, the restroom door was visible in the corner, almost mocking her with how close—and yet far—it was.

Ending 1

Momo staggered toward the restroom door, her pace quickening despite her exhaustion. Her paw trembled as she reached for the handle, pushing it open with a burst of desperation-fueled strength. She rushed inside, locking the door behind her, her breathing ragged as she fumbled to remove her robe. With mere moments to spare, she perched on the edge of the toilet, sighing in immense relief as she finally let go. The tension drained from her body like a tide receding, leaving her slumped against the wall, utterly spent but victorious.

“Never again,” she muttered to herself, her tail flicking weakly behind her. Despite the chaos and stress of the day, she couldn’t help but feel a small sense of triumph. She had won—not just against Marshmallow, but against every challenge thrown her way. The Academy was safe, and so was her dignity.

Ending 2

As Momo darted toward the restroom door, a sharp pang stopped her in her tracks. She froze, her paws pressing against her middle as her body refused to cooperate any longer. A small, warm spurt escaped before she could stop it, and her cheeks burned with embarrassment. “No, no, no,” she muttered, hobbling forward in a desperate bid to make it in time. But the exertion of the day had taken its toll, and just as her paw brushed the handle, her body gave in completely.

Warmth spread beneath her robe, and she stood frozen in place, her tail drooping as realization sank in. She glanced around the empty library, her ears flattening with a mix of frustration and relief. At least no one was around to see her moment of defeat. Taking a deep breath, she straightened herself, flicking her tail lightly in a bid to recover some dignity. “Well,” she sighed, forcing a small smile, “at least the ghosts didn’t win this time.”

Despite the mishap, Momo was never one to dwell on failure. She cleaned herself up as best she could, determined to carry on. The Academy was safe, Marshmallow was defeated, and she had proven her strength in the face of impossible odds.

Part 3

The morning air was crisp as Momo stood atop the Magic Academy’s observatory, gazing up at the sky. The stars twinkled faintly against the fading night, but something about their glow felt off. A familiar unease pricked at her senses, and her tail flicked anxiously. The peace she had worked so hard to restore was short-lived. A sudden flash of light near the horizon drew her attention, and there it was—Marshmallow’s grinning, ghostly face glaring down from the stratosphere, his laughter echoing faintly in her mind. “Impossible,” she muttered, clutching her wand. She had defeated him twice already, once in the school and again beneath the ocean’s depths. How could he be back?

As she wrestled with the questions in her mind, a soft voice called out behind her. It was one of the Academy’s elder scholars, a wise owl familiar who had guided her in past adventures. “He’s grown stronger,” the owl warned, ruffling its feathers. “He’s drawn power from the celestial layers, and he’s waiting for you up there.” Momo’s paws tensed. She wasn’t one to back down from a fight, but battling in the skies would be a challenge unlike any she had faced before.

With no time to waste, Momo began her preparations. She strapped on a sturdy glass helmet, enchanted to let her breathe freely at high altitudes, and adjusted her broomstick for the long journey ahead. Magic runes etched along its surface glowed softly, reinforcing its strength for the dangerous mission. “This time, I’ll end it for good,” she promised herself, leaping onto the broom and shooting into the sky, her cape billowing behind her as she ascended into the unknown.

Momo soared into the Troposphere, the first and lowest layer of Earth’s atmosphere. The air was cool and crisp, though her enchanted helmet ensured she felt no discomfort from the high speeds or thin air. As she flew, a faint twinge in her lower abdomen caught her attention—a small, unwelcome reminder of the tea she’d had before her departure. She shifted slightly on her broom, dismissing the sensation with a flick of her tail. “Not now,” she muttered. With Marshmallow drawing power from the skies, she couldn’t afford to be distracted.

Her wand glowed faintly in her paw as she prepared for the first wave of ghosts. A cluster of them appeared suddenly, swirling and shrieking as they approached. Their translucent forms shimmered in the soft light of the clouds, and Momo wasted no time. She traced runes quickly, her movements precise as her spells banished the spirits one by one. With each victory, she felt her confidence grow. But she knew these were just the warm-up; Marshmallow always had tricks up his spectral sleeves.

Her instincts proved correct when a massive shadow flitted across the clouds. Momo glanced upward to see a giant golden-crowned flying fox, its leathery wings outstretched as it glided effortlessly through the air. The creature’s glowing eyes betrayed its possession, and it turned sharply toward her with a ghostly screech. Though technically a species of bat, its sheer size and speed made it a formidable foe. The flying fox dove at her, forcing Momo to barrel-roll out of its path.

The battle was intense, with the possessed creature darting through the sky faster than most of the ghosts she’d faced. Momo dodged its attacks, tracing rune after rune in rapid succession. Sparks flew as her spells collided with the flying fox’s ghostly aura, slowly weakening the spirit’s hold. With one final spell, she struck the creature’s core, and the ghost let out a wail before vanishing into the ether. The flying fox shuddered mid-flight, its glowing eyes returning to a warm, natural hue. Freed from the ghost’s grip, it flapped its wings lazily and disappeared into the clouds.

Breathing heavily, Momo steadied herself on her broomstick. She could feel her bladder protesting faintly against the strain of the battle, but she ignored it once more. With a determined flick of her wand, she adjusted her grip and set her sights upward. The Thermosphere awaited, and she had no doubt that the challenges ahead would only grow more intense.

As Momo ascended into the Thermosphere, the skies grew darker, and the air around her brimmed with energy. Lightning-like arcs of magic danced across the clouds as ghosts materialized, their glowing forms cutting through the inky expanse. The simplicity of this level belied its challenges, and Momo knew better than to let her guard down. She gripped her wand tightly, focusing on the steady stream of ghosts that came her way. The familiar motions of tracing runes were almost second nature now, but the persistent pressure in her bladder made her movements slightly stiffer than usual.

Her focus wavered briefly as a sharp pang reminded her of the strain she’d been ignoring. She shook her head, trying to push the distraction aside. “Not now,” she muttered for what felt like the hundredth time. Her tail flicked nervously as she cast another spell, banishing a ghost that had crept too close. Despite her discomfort, she pressed onward, her determination unwavering.

Midway through the Thermosphere, a sudden, crystal-like shimmer caught her eye. Emerging from the darkness was a spider-like creature, its legs faceted like amethyst shards, and its body pulsating with ghostly light. A spirit had taken control of the crystalline beast, turning it into a formidable guardian. Momo tensed, recognizing the challenge ahead. To defeat the creature, she would need to use the purple stun spell, a spiral-shaped rune she had perfected but rarely needed. It had been designed for underwater jellyfish in her previous adventure, but there had been no opportunity to use it then. Now, she had no choice.

The spider scuttled toward her with unnerving speed, its crystalline legs clinking against the unseen floor of the Thermosphere. Momo raised her wand, tracing the spiral with as much precision as her trembling paw allowed. The spell shot forward, enveloping the spider in a burst of purple light that slowed its movements momentarily. She wasted no time, following up with several quick runes to weaken the ghost’s hold. The battle was brief but intense, and with a final spell, the ghost shattered, its remnants dispersing into harmless fragments of light.

Momo floated in place for a moment, her breathing shallow as she clutched her abdomen briefly, trying to regain her composure. “Focus, Momo,” she whispered, her tone equal parts determined and strained. The spider’s crystalline form dulled as it returned to its dormant state, skittering off harmlessly into the void. Taking a deep breath, Momo adjusted her grip on her wand and her position on the broom. The final frontier lay ahead, and the next layer of the atmosphere—the Mesosphere—promised even greater trials.

As Momo ascended into the Mesosphere, the air around her seemed thinner, the magical energy less oppressive but no less dangerous. Ghosts drifted lazily through the expanse, their translucent forms illuminated by faint streaks of meteors cutting across the dark sky. Banishing them was relatively straightforward, a brief reprieve compared to her earlier challenges. Each rune she traced was precise, her spells cutting through the spectral forms with ease. Yet, even as she defeated ghost after ghost, the growing discomfort in her abdomen was becoming harder to ignore. She paused briefly, pressing a paw against her middle as her tail flicked nervously. “Just keep going,” she whispered, her voice tight.

Her momentary relief was short-lived as a familiar structure appeared ahead: the lightning prism, an enemy she remembered vividly from her simulations. The prism was a large, angular construct of glowing energy, its core pulsating with raw, electrical power. In her training sessions, it had been challenging but manageable. This time, however, something was different. The prism moved at twice the speed it had in the simulations, its attacks erratic and unpredictable. Momo’s heart sank as she gripped her wand, realizing the battle ahead would be far harder than she anticipated.

The prism began its assault immediately, firing bolts of energy in rapid succession. Momo darted and weaved through the sky, her broomstick straining under the sharp turns and sudden drops. The first wave of attacks grazed her side, sending a jolt of pain through her body. She hissed softly, knowing she had already taken one of her precious three hits. The pressure in her bladder surged with the jarring movements, making her wince. Gritting her teeth, she focused on tracing the runes required to weaken the prism.

The second hit came when the prism feigned a retreat, only to surge forward with a burst of speed. The impact sent her spiraling briefly before she righted herself, clutching her middle with one paw as she steadied her broomstick. Her breath came in ragged bursts, but she refused to give up. With a final surge of energy, she traced the most complex rune, sending a bolt of magic directly into the prism’s core. The structure vibrated violently before evaporating into a harmless wisp of light, the ghostly energy dissipating into nothing.

Hovering in place, Momo exhaled shakily, her paw instinctively pressing against her abdomen. The strain from the battle, combined with the mounting pressure in her bladder, made it difficult to focus. But she couldn’t stop now. Adjusting her grip on her wand, she set her sights upward. The Mesosphere had been conquered, but the final layers of the atmosphere—and Marshmallow—still lay ahead. With determination, albeit uncomfortably, she continued her ascent.

The Thermosphere stretched endlessly above Momo, its dark expanse dotted with brilliant stars that seemed to pulse with ghostly energy. Normally, this layer would have been the easiest for her to handle—just simple spells to clear the possessed stars forming constellations. But in her current state, even this proved to be a grueling ordeal. Each movement on her broomstick sent a sharp pang through her abdomen, the pressure she had been suppressing now becoming an almost unbearable distraction.

The possessed stars were relentless, swarming her in clusters and demanding precise spellwork to banish. Each constellation lit up with runes she had to trace quickly before they could overwhelm her. Momo’s paw moved with practiced precision, but the strain of holding her focus against both the spectral onslaught and her internal struggle was taking its toll. She gritted her teeth as she dodged a sudden burst of starlight from an enraged constellation, narrowly avoiding what would have been a devastating hit.

Hordes of possessed stars loomed ahead, their light casting eerie patterns across the void. Momo traced the necessary runes with growing urgency, her movements slightly shaky but determined. The spells erupted from her wand in quick succession, each one bursting into a cascade of sparks that returned the stars to their natural brilliance. One by one, the constellations disbanded, their ghostly auras dissipating into harmless motes of light. By the time the final cluster was defeated, Momo was panting heavily, her body trembling from the effort.

Hovering in the quiet aftermath, Momo pressed her paw firmly against her middle, a soft gasp escaping her lips as she struggled to compose herself. She could feel every beat of her heart, every strained muscle in her body, but she forced herself to push forward. The Exosphere awaited, and with it, the final confrontation with Marshmallow.

Adjusting her position on the broomstick, Momo flew higher, breaking through the edge of the Thermosphere. The sky around her grew darker, the stars now distant pinpricks in the vastness of space. At the center of it all loomed Marshmallow, transformed into a massive, demonic sun. His glowing eyes and mocking grin radiated malice, his laughter echoing faintly through the void. Momo clenched her wand tightly, her resolve hardening. This would be the ultimate battle—the one to end it all.

As Momo entered the Exosphere, the vast emptiness around her was filled with an overwhelming heat and light emanating from Marshmallow. He had transformed into a gargantuan, demonic sun, his fiery form radiating malice and his grin stretching wide across his glowing surface. His voice boomed through the void, mocking her with grim amusement. “Do you remember the simulations?” he taunted, his glowing eyes locking onto hers. “The only way you ever succeeded flawlessly was by using the time-slowing spell I provided. Unfortunately for you, that’s a luxury you won’t have this time.”

Momo gripped her wand tightly, her tail flicking in defiance as she steadied herself on her broomstick. Marshmallow’s laughter echoed ominously. “Still, I wish you good luck,” he continued, his tone dripping with sarcasm. “And if by some miracle you survive, I’ll gladly help expand the Academy. Who knows? You might even want to call on me to brush up on your skills.”

Without warning, Marshmallow launched his first attack: three waves of meteors streaking toward her, their fiery trails lighting up the dark expanse. Each meteor required two precise runes to dispel, and the sequence grew more complex with every wave. Momo darted through the void, her broomstick straining under the sharp maneuvers as she traced the runes with rapid precision. The first wave was manageable, but the second forced her to swerve dangerously close to Marshmallow’s fiery surface. By the time the third wave came, her paw was trembling, the effort of maintaining her focus pushing her to the brink.

As the final meteor disintegrated under her spell, Momo barely had time to catch her breath before Marshmallow began his last, desperate assault. His massive form surged forward, hurtling toward her with deliberate, terrifying speed. The sheer heat and force of his approach made the air around her shimmer, and Momo knew that one mistake could spell disaster. She traced runes furiously, the magic forming barriers to slow him down. Each spell drained her reserves further, but she refused to give in.

With one final, explosive spell, Momo struck Marshmallow’s core. His fiery form shuddered violently, a piercing wail echoing through the void as he began to collapse in on himself. The light dimmed, and the demonic sun fragmented into harmless embers, hurtling back toward the Earth like falling stars. Momo hovered in place for a moment, her chest heaving as she watched Marshmallow’s remnants streak across the sky.

Her exhaustion was overwhelming, and the persistent pressure in her abdomen made her wince with every movement. She turned her broomstick sharply, descending rapidly back toward the Academy. The familiar sight of the observatory’s balcony came into view, and she landed with a soft thud, placing her broom carefully back in its stand. Without a moment to spare, she darted inside, her paws quick against the stone floors as she rushed to find relief.

Momo rushed inside the Academy, her heart racing as adrenaline from the battle began to fade. Her body ached from the strain of the fight, and the persistent pressure in her bladder was now impossible to ignore. Every step sent a sharp reminder of just how close she was to her limit. The bathroom wasn’t far—just down the corridor and around the corner. She quickened her pace, her tail flicking anxiously behind her, ears flattening slightly as she fought to stay composed.

Ending 1

Reaching the bathroom door, Momo fumbled with the handle, her paws trembling from exhaustion and urgency. She pushed it open with a burst of desperate energy, locking it behind her as she moved quickly to the toilet. Her robe was cast aside in a flurry, and with mere seconds to spare, she finally let go. Relief washed over her like a calming spell, and she slumped against the wall, her tail flicking lazily in the aftermath.

As her breathing steadied, Momo couldn’t help but chuckle softly to herself. “You did it,” she muttered, a small smile playing across her lips. Despite the chaos, the battle, and the near-miss, she had succeeded. Marshmallow was defeated once more, and the Academy was safe. She took a moment to compose herself before slipping back into her robe and stepping out into the hallway, ready to celebrate her hard-won victory.

Ending 2

As Momo rounded the final corner, a sharp pang stopped her in her tracks. She clutched her middle, her legs locking instinctively as her body rebelled against her will. “No, no, no,” she whispered, hobbling forward in a desperate attempt to close the remaining distance. Her paw reached for the door handle, but just as she touched it, the pressure became too much. Warmth spread beneath her robe, and she froze, her heart sinking as she realized what had happened.

Her ears flattened in embarrassment as she glanced around the empty hallway, relieved that no one was there to witness her defeat. She sighed heavily, her tail curling around her leg as she stood still for a moment, letting the weight of the day’s events sink in. “Well,” she muttered softly, forcing a rueful smile, “at least Marshmallow didn’t win this time.”

Momo composed herself as best she could, resolving to clean up and move forward. Despite the mishap, she knew the bigger victory had been hers. The Academy was safe, and Marshmallow had been defeated once more.

Epilogue

A few hours after her final battle, Momo stepped out onto the balcony of the Magic Academy, her paw trailing along the cool stone railing as she gazed at the horizon. The stars above were tranquil once again, the chaos of Marshmallow’s attack now a distant memory. Her ears twitched as a faint groan reached her from the far corner of the balcony. She turned to see Marshmallow, his once-intimidating form now dim and shrunken, slumped against the wall of the Academy. His usual mocking grin was replaced with a grimace of pain, though he still tried to mask it with a hint of bravado.

“So,” he rasped, his voice still tinged with his trademark mischief. “About that expansion we talked about?” He tried to sit up straighter but winced, the effort clearly taking a toll. Despite his vulnerability, his glowing eyes still flickered with determination.

Momo hesitated for a moment, then nodded, her expression softening. “You’re not wrong,” she said, crossing her arms. “The Academy could use an upgrade. And if you’re willing to play fair for once, I think we can work something out.” Marshmallow chuckled weakly, clearly relieved, though he didn’t let it show too much. “Fair, huh? I suppose I can try.”

Over the following weeks, Momo worked closely with the Academy’s faculty and even Marshmallow himself to design a new wing. The expansion was unlike anything the Academy had ever seen: a futuristic training arena equipped with magical projections that could recreate any challenge or adversary, including the most formidable final bosses from Momo’s past battles. The arena could shift its terrain, change its atmosphere, and adapt to the specific strengths and weaknesses of its users, ensuring that Momo—and any future students—could hone their skills to perfection.

Momo visited the new arena often, her broomstick slung over her shoulder and her wand glowing faintly in her paw. She would step into the shimmering chamber, the walls flickering with light as the arena adjusted itself for her next challenge. Marshmallow, true to his word, often appeared as a sparring partner, grinning as he tested her with increasingly clever attacks. Despite their rocky history, the ghost had proven to be a valuable—if still infuriating—ally.

As Momo stood in the center of the arena after a particularly challenging simulation, she looked around at the sleek, glowing walls and couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride. The Academy was stronger than ever, and so was she. No matter what challenges lay ahead, Momo knew she would face them head-on, her wand in paw and her confidence unwavering.
