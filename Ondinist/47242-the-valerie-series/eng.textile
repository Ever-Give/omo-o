That's the last of the Valerie series, at least for the time being. I hope that reading these stories has given you at least some of the enjoyment I have had in writing them.

My original intention had been to write a standalone piece, simply as a description of a fantasy and I was surprised by the way that that the characters took life. Sometimes one story suggested a narrative for the next. At other times you, the readers, suggested ways of taking the series forward, for example by developing Angela and Léa into more central characters.

For anybody who wants to go back and re-read any of these stories, a PDF of the series, lightly edited to improve the flow, is attached.
