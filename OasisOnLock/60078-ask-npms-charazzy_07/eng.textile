Asi: I don't need one! It was one time, then, because I really wanted to be Queen!

Asriel huffed in response to this comment and averted her eyes from the other Monster as her bladder's contents sloshed quietly another time with her movement.

Ehehe~ I had a feeling you wouldn't back down from a challenge!~

This is going to be so very, very interesting!~

Chr: I... suppose it will. You can check back on that tomorrow.

Hey I’m just saying though you might look cute with a diaper on

}}

Asi: I'm not supposed to break uniform, and even then, I'm not trying to look 'cute' for you; I'm your Royalty!

Yeah, that's all!~ See you tomorrow!~

Chr: ... The Throne Room's matters are hereby adjourned.
