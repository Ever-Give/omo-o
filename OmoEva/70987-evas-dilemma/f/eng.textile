Eva’s Dilemma

Eva woke up in the middle of the night. She was lying on her back with her legs spread apart. She was afraid to go back to sleep after having had a nightmare. Eva was wearing pink cotton panties and a pink bra. A matching set with a cute pattern of hearts on it.

She had always had bladder problems. Hers were she didn’t know she had to pee until she was bursting. She has trouble holding it in and often leaks and has accidents. It’s an embarrassing problem especially now that she’s 24. Eva didn’t know it but her bladder was about to burst.

Feeling anxious also worsens Eva’s need to pee and she feels anxious often.

Eva sat up and turned on her bedside lamp. Sitting up wasn’t good for Eva’s already bursting bladder. She suddenly felt that she had to go pee and badly too! Eva gasped and began to shake. She was trying so hard not to let any pee out.

But her bladder was begging her for relief! She felt urine heading towards her urethra. Eva quickly pressed a hand against her crotch. Squeezing her thighs together around her hand. “Please no! I need to hold it in!” Eva cried out.

Eva’s bladder however had other plans. It pushed down on its own, causing a spurt of pee to go into Eva’s panties. A small wet spot formed on the front of her panties. She really felt desperate now! She swung her legs over and got up from the bed.

Doing a pee-pee dance, swaying her hips from side to side. Struggling to keep her pee inside her. She could see the toilet from where she stood. Which caused another spurt to come out and another. The wet spot on her panties getting bigger.

Each step she took toward the toilet, her urethra released more urine straight into her panties. Eva stopped walking and clenched her muscles as much as she could. She knew she wasn’t going to make it, unless she let some more out, enough to satisfy her very full bladder. It was worth a try, better than completely having an accident. Eva relaxed her muscles enough to cause some urine to begin coming out.

Her panties felt warm and she almost didn’t want to stop. Once she felt like her bladder wasn’t as full, she began to clench her muscles to stop peeing. But it wasn’t working! Eva cried out “No! Oh no! Please stop! I need to make it to the toilet!”

But her bladder wouldn’t listen. Eva began to run to the toilet. Which only made her pee more. Pee running down her legs. By the time she reached the toilet, pee was spraying out of her like a firehose.

Eva couldn’t stand anymore, and fell to her knees in front of the toilet. It felt so good to let all the pee out and she let out a soft moan and then blushed. Tears going down her face, she felt so embarrassed.

Hope you enjoyed this short story. I might continue with more parts. :)

Here is a picture of how I think Eva would look. That I found on Google images. The picture isn’t mine. I do not claim this picture as mine.

Eva’s Video Call:

Eva had been chatting online with this woman Maya for a few months. Maya is very beautiful and kind. Eva met her on a chatroom. After a month of talking they exchanged phone numbers and started texting each other. Eva really liked Maya and had a bit of a crush on her.

Today Eva and Maya planned to video chat with each other. Eva is really shy and was feeling very anxious about this. Eva already knew how Maya looked since Maya sent her a picture of herself. One thing Maya didn’t know about Eva was Eva’s bladder problems. Eva was afraid of Maya finding out and being grossed out.

Texting between Eva and Maya:

Maya: Are you ready to video chat now?

Eva: Sure…

Maya: Are you nervous?

Eva: Yes I am.

Maya: Don’t worry I don’t bite. 🙂

Eva saw the video chat accept or decline pop up on her phone. She could feel her heart pounding fast in her chest. She didn’t realize it yet but her bladder was over full. Eva was wearing pink short shorts and a white tank top. Underneath she had white cotton panties and a white bra.

She was sitting in her bedroom on a chair at a desk. Her phone propped up with a stand. Eva pressed the accept button. Maya’s face popped up and she was smiling. “Hey Eva. Wow you’re so gorgeous! I don’t understand why you never showed me a picture of you before.”

Eva blushed “I’m just really shy.”

She suddenly realized she had to pee and quite badly too. But Eva had just entered the video call with Maya. She felt too shy to say she needed to go. Eva was also very anxious which only caused her to need to go even worse. She crossed her legs.

Surely she could hold it in for a while, she was a grown woman. Only Eva’s face and top half of her body was visible on camera. The more Eva admired Maya’s beautiful face, the more anxious she became. Eva could feel her urethra starting to quiver. “No…hold it in please.” Eva thought.

Maya noticed Eva seemed anxious. But didn’t want to mention it. She started asking Eva questions. “So how was work today? I remember you said you’re a librarian at a library.”

Eva’s need to pee was growing worse by the seconds. She was using all her will power just to keep the ocean of pee inside her. “Work was good. It was a relaxing day as usual. My job isn’t very stressful.”

Maya smiled “That’s great to hear! I had a great day at work as well! I had some videos I wanted to show you that I took with my phone. Some beautiful fountains of water spraying upwards.”

She shared her screen and began playing the videos. Complete with water sounds.

Eva could barely contain herself. Her legs began to shake. She was trying so hard not to let any pee out. But the sounds of the water and the sight of the fountains proved too much for her. She could feel urine rushing towards her urethra. Eva sneaked a hand between her legs, pressing it hard against her crotch.

Maya smiled “Isn’t it beautiful? I love the sight and sound of water. It’s so relaxing!”

Eva hoped Maya would turn the videos off, so she just agreed. “Yeah so beautiful and relaxing.”

But Maya switched the video to a waterfall. “Here’s another video I took. This time of a waterfall. I love this one even more!”

Eva couldn’t take it. She felt urine at the tip of her urethra. Eva pressed harder against her crotch but it didn’t work. She felt a long spurt of pee leak out into her panties. She squirmed in her seat.

So far none was on the outside of her shorts. But she felt her panties slightly damp. Her eyes teary. She was going to have a big accident at this rate. Especially if Maya didn’t stop the videos.

Maya saw Eva’s teary eyes but didn’t think anything was wrong. “So beautiful it brings tears to your eyes right?”

Eva couldn’t keep her eyes off the video. Which only caused more pee to leak out. This time she could feel herself dribbling pee in her panties. She clenched and clenched trying to stop it, but it was a leak that wouldn’t stop. Her panties felt wetter and she couldn’t stop leaking.

She could feel tears going down her face.

Maya noticed this and suspected something was wrong. She paused the video. “Eva what’s wrong? Did I do something wrong?”

Eva decided to tell the truth, as embarrassing as it was. “Y-You didn’t do anything wrong. I have a bladder problem where I don’t know I have to pee till I’m bursting. I have trouble holding it in and often leak and have accidents.”

Maya’s eyes widened “Is that problem happening now? You could of just told me you had to pee. I could of waited for you.”

“I-I was too shy to say. Plus I thought I could hold it in. But I’m leaking and I feel ready to explode. The water fountain and waterfall videos didn’t help either.” Eva explained.

Maya looked at Eva and said “Go ahead and go to the bathroom. I’ll wait here for you.”

Eva nodded. She got up from her chair, still constantly leaking. She stepped back a bit. Her whole body in view now. Her panties felt really wet. She uncrossed her legs and looked down at her crotch.

No wet spot on the front of her pink short shorts yet. Eva turned to walk towards the bathroom. When she suddenly heard the sound of running water. She was still in view of her phone camera, so Maya could see her whole body. Eva gasped as she felt a big wave of pressure hit her bladder.

Eva clenched her muscles but they were too tired and not working. She felt her panties grow warm. “N-No! I-I can’t hold it in!”

She squirmed and did a potty dance. The front of her pink short shorts darkening. She even pressed both hands against her crotch. Trying to stop the flow. But it wouldn’t stop and began to even go down her legs.

Creating a puddle below.

“Eva! I’m so sorry! I pressed play on the video by accident!” Maya exclaimed.

Eva kept peeing for what seemed like forever, until she finally stopped. A huge puddle below her.

She was horrified and began to cry. “You must think I’m disgusting!”

Maya closed out the video of the waterfall and smiled. “I don’t think you’re disgusting. I actually found it sexy. Would you like to meet in person and go on a date?”

Eva couldn’t believe her ears. Maya found it sexy and wanted to go on a date with her?! This was a dream come true! Eva never thought she would find someone who accepted her for who she was.

“I’d love to.” Eva smiled.

Little did Eva know, that Maya had pressed play on the waterfall video on purpose. Maya had wanted Eva to have an accident. She also had a plan for their date. A plan that would end in wet panties once more for Eva. Maya couldn’t wait!

Here is a picture of how I think Maya would look. I found this picture using Google images. I do not own this picture. This picture isn’t mine.

Stay tuned for more. 🙂

Eva’s Date Night - Part One

Eva was getting ready for her date with Maya. She had on a white summer dress with a pattern of cherries all over it. Underneath she had white cotton panties with teddy bear patterns and a matching white bra with teddy bear patterns as well. She was so excited but also anxious as well. She didn’t want a repeat of last time, where she had an accident.

Even though Maya found Eva’s accident sexy. Eva didn’t want to ruin her nice clothes. Just to be sure that she didn’t have an accident, Eva pulled up her dress and pulled down her panties. She sat on the toilet even though she didn’t feel a urge to pee. She gasped in surprise as she started peeing hard into the toilet.

After she was finished, she cleaned herself off with toilet paper and stood back up. Putting her panties back on and pulling her dress down to cover herself. She washed her hands and put on some red lipstick. Eva wanted to look good for Maya. She was ready.

Texts between Eva and Maya:

Maya: I’m here, are you ready yet?

Eva: I’m ready, I can’t wait!

Maya: Me neither! This will be fun!

Eva walked outside her apartment and locked it with a key. She had a purse with her and her cell phone. Getting into Maya’s car. Eva put on her seatbelt. She noticed two small lemonades in see through cups in the cup holders.

Maya smiled and said “Great to meet you in person Eva! Here I got you a lemonade! It’s a hot day so it’s good to stay hydrated!”

She handed Eva the lemonade. Little did Eva know, Maya put some crushed up diuretic pills in Eva’s drink.

Eva smiled “Thank you! Where are we going tonight?” She took a couple gulps from the lemonade. It tasted so good.

“We are going to my apartment. For a date night. I have some things planned for tonight.”

Eva took a couple more gulps from the lemonade. She figured this small amount of liquid shouldn’t cause her any problems. Soon she was done with it.

Maya laughed “Wow Eva! You must of really loved that lemonade! You can have mine if you want.

She didn’t know why but she felt really thirsty for some reason. Eva grabbed the other lemonade and began to take big sips from it. She finished it pretty quickly. Eva wasn’t worried though. Maya had to have a bathroom in her apartment, if Eva needed to go.

Eva wasn’t aware but the diuretics that were in the first lemonade were already effecting her bladder. Her bladder was filling up to the point of overflowing. She didn’t feel anything yet though. Due to her bladder problem. Eva looked outside the window.

Maya said “We are finally here! Come on, I can’t wait for you to see my place!”

She parked and shut off the engine of the car. Taking the keys with her. She went around the other side and opened the door for Eva.

Eva got down from the car and closed the car door. Maya grabbed her hand and led her up the first flight of stairs. “Sorry the elevator is broken. We have to go up two more flights of stairs before we reach my place.”

Suddenly Eva felt it, she had to go pee and she had to go NOW. She stopped and her legs began to shake. “Maya…” Eva blushed.

Maya stopped and looked back at Eva. She could see her legs shaking. “Eva do you have to pee?”

Eva gasped as some pee leaked out into her panties. She felt so full. More full than she had ever felt. “I don’t know if I can make it. I really really have to go. I already leaked…”

Maya looked calm on the outside. But she was getting excited and turned on.

“Eva you can make it. It isn’t too far. I believe in you.”

Maya pulled Eva by the hand and continued walking up the stairs.

Each step sent a spurt of urine into Eva’s panties. She regretted drinking all that lemonade. They finally reached the last stairs before Maya’s place. Eva continued walking, she clenched her muscles as tight as she could. So far so good.

Once they reached the front door of Maya’s apartment, Maya began looking for her key.

Eva’s muscles were weakening. Her legs shaking again. The urine threatening to escape. “M-Maya? I need to go now. I don’t know how much longer I can hold it in…”

She felt her urethra start to quiver and felt a tingling sensation at the tip of her urethra. Urine was at the tip. Eva crossed her legs tightly. Slightly bent over. “Maya?! Maya please hurry!”

A long spurt went into her panties and then another. Eva whimpered. “Maya it’s coming out. Please!”

Maya finally opened the door with her key and let Eva in. She closed the door behind her and locked it.

“Bathroom is all the way down the hall and to the right.” Maya explained. She knew Eva wouldn’t make it. She gave her the wrong directions on purpose.

Eva started walking down the hall. It was a long hall. She felt her urge to pee grow stronger. She started walking faster. Finally she reached the door but when she opened it. It was just a closet with a bucket and cleaning supplies.

“No…! I need to pee! So bad! I need the toilet!” Eva cried out.

She began to do a potty dance and she saw Maya watching. A blush spread across Eva’s face.

Eva was shaking, trying not to explode right then and there. She didn’t want to have an accident on her first date with Maya.

Maya began to rub Eva’s lower back “It’s okay. Just let it out. I don’t mind.”

The rubbing of her lower back was causing Eva to lose her grip on her bladder. She didn’t want her dress to get wet. “I don’t want my dress to get wet.”

“Then pee in the bucket. I’ll help you.” Maya said. She then told Eva “Stop moving. I need to lower you to a squatting position.”

Eva obeyed and stopped moving. A big wave of pressure hit her bladder at that point. She bit her bottom lip. Something she did when anxious. Maya put the bucket underneath Eva and pushed Eva into a squatting position over the bucket. Maya held Eva’s dress up out of the way.

At first it was just a trickle. Eva could feel it coming out into her panties. She pushed down and the trickle increased. The front of her panties getting wet. She so badly wanted to pee fast.

But she felt shy peeing into a bucket in front of someone she liked. Eva could hear the urine hitting the bucket slowly. It was torture. “This isn’t working. I’ve never peed in a bucket before and I’m too shy.”

“You just need to relax. Think of yourself on a toilet. Close your eyes if you have to.” Maya said softly.

Eva closed her eyes and imagined herself on a toilet. She relaxed and heard the urine hitting the bucket. She was peeing fast and hard. Eva moaned in relief. Her bladder emptying.

Eventually she finished. Her panties soaked with pee and dripping. “I need new panties…” Eva blushed. She took off her panties and squeezed out the urine into the bucket. “Where is your bathroom?”

Maya smiled “To the left. Sorry I said the wrong instructions before.”

Eva grabbed her purse and walked into the bathroom. Closing the door and locking it behind her. She dried herself off with toilet paper and put her soaked panties in the sink. Her dress was dry thankfully. Eva opened her purse and put on a fresh pair of panties.

Some white ones with lemons on them. She went out of the bathroom and smiled at Maya. “I’m ready for our date now.”

Eva’s Date Night - Part Two

Maya led Eva to the living room. She gestured toward the couch “Take a seat Eva, I was going to put a movie for us to watch and make popcorn and drinks.”

Eva sat down on the couch, she smiled “That sounds great. I can’t wait!”

Maya went into the kitchen which was nearby and put some popcorn in the microwave. While it was popping she got some drinks ready. She poured some iced tea in two tall glasses. She crushed two more diuretic pills and mixed it in Eva’s glass. Mixing it so well that Eva wouldn’t notice anything amiss.

The microwave beeped and Maya got the popcorn out. Putting it in a large bowl for them to share. She brought the bowl to where Eva was at and set it on the table. She then went back and grabbed the two tall iced tea glasses and set them down. Making sure to take a sip of one of the glasses so that Eva would pick the one that had the crushed pills in it.

Maya sat down next to Eva and turned on the tv with the remote. She went on Netflix and put on a scary movie. One that she knew had a lot of jump scares. Eva grabbed her glass of iced tea and took two gulps from it. “This iced tea is good. Did you make it yourself?”

“Yes I did. Thank you.” Maya smiled.

Eva and Maya continued watching the movie. Both eating popcorn and drinking iced tea. Eva had finished her iced tea rather fast. She didn’t know it at the time but her bladder once again was working overtime. Ready to pop.

A jump scare happened with a monster appearing. Eva gasped and jumped a bit. She suddenly felt damp in her panties. Had she leaked? She didn’t even feel like going.

But just as she finished that thought, she felt it. A really bad urge to pee. Her legs began to shake, she had to go so bad, she felt she couldn’t move without peeing everywhere. Eva blushed and she squeezed her thighs together tightly. She had to let Maya know.

“M-Maya?” Eva stuttered.

“Yes Eva? What’s wrong?” Maya answered her eyes still looking at the tv.

“I need to go, I don’t think I can make it to the bathroom.” Eva blushed.

Maya paused the movie and looked at Eva. “You have to go that bad? Didn’t you just go recently?”

Eva’s urethra was beginning to quiver and she could feel urine beginning to make its way to the entrance. She knew it was going to come out soon. Whether she wanted it to or not.

“Yes I know. But it’s about to come out and I don’t know how much control I’ll have. Maya I don’t want to ruin your couch. But something is seriously wrong. I normally have bladder problems but never this bad.” Eva’s eyes were teary.

“Eva, I don’t care if you ruin the couch. I like you.” Maya looked into Eva’s eyes and caressed Eva’s face. She then pressed her lips against Eva’s.

Eva was so surprised that she felt some urine escape into her panties. She kissed Maya back. Maya pulled back and smiled. She put a hand underneath Eva’s dress on her thigh. “Eva I can help you hold it in.”

“How?” Eva asked confused.

“Let me press my hand against you. Putting pressure, may help.” Maya explained.

“B-But I’ll pee on your hand.” Eva said.

“Don’t worry. It will be fine.” Maya replied.

“Okay.” Eva said, still unsure but willing to give it a try.

Eva stopped squeezing her thighs together and spread them slightly. Maya quickly lifted Eva’s dress and pressed her hand against Eva’s privates. Eva sighed in relief, it did help a bit.

“How does it feel?” Maya asked.

“A bit better. I don’t feel like peeing everywhere anymore.” Eva replied.

But the relief was short lived. Suddenly Eva felt a cramp in her bladder, she felt about to explode. “M-Maya! Oh no! I can’t… I can’t hold it in!”

She felt her bladder push down on its own and a jet of urine escaped into her panties. Wetting Maya’s hand. Eva gasped and put her own hand against Maya’s hand. Trying to hold it in.

“Maya I…, I want to get up and try and make it to the toilet.” Eva said.

“You really think you can? Okay then.” Maya said.

Eva moved her hand away from herself and Maya moved her hand too. Eva got up from the couch. A big wave of pressure hit her bladder. She pushed a hand against her crotch and began to walk toward the bathroom. One step, two step, three step.

She stopped in the middle of the room. Struggling to keep the ocean of urine inside her. Another step (spurt), another step (longer spurt), another step (constant trickling into her panties). Eva started to walk a bit faster. She was leaking slowly into her panties, a leak she couldn’t stop.

Eva moaned, it felt so good the pee leaking out. She didn’t know what came over her. Continuing to walk, she was in the hallway now. She just needed to walk a few more steps and turn left. Her bladder had other plans though.

She felt the trickling increase. Eva kept thinking about the toilet. Releasing her urine into it. The trickling started coming out more. “No! Stop it!” Eva yelled at her bladder.

Eva started to speed walk. Which only made her pee come out more. Leaking down her leg. She turned left and turned the knob on the door. Swinging the door open.

She didn’t bother to close and lock it. There was no time! Eva pulled her hand away from her crotch and used all her strength to hold back the rest of her urine. It was still coming out down her leg slowly. Eva pulled her dress up.

Eva pulled her panties down and sat on the toilet. She relaxed and exploded into the toilet. Urine gushing out full blast. She moaned in relief. Closing her eyes.

Maya had been following the whole time, not wanting to miss a thing. She watched from the doorway as Eva peed, legs spread apart. Maya loved the look on Eva’s face. How had she gotten so lucky to find a woman with such a bad bladder problem? She smiled.

Eva eventually finished peeing after what seemed like ages. She cleaned herself off and took off her panties. Leaving them on the ground. Eva didn’t know it but the effects of the diuretic weren’t going to wear off for a couple of hours. It might even continue into the next day.

“You can take a shower. I have some clothes that should fit you. I prepared ahead of time.” Maya said.

It clicked in Eva’s mind now. Why Maya had asked her about her clothes, bra and panties size.

Eva smiled “Yes I think I’d like a shower. Could you bring me some clean clothes and panties?”

“Sure Eva.” Maya nodded and left the room.

Eva closed the door and began to strip. Taking off her dress and bra. She was naked now and got into the shower. Turning the water on. She began to shower. Using body wash and shampoo.

Maya opened the door and put Eva’s clean clothes on the counter. Some pajama shorts, a tank top, and a pink bra and panties. Maya left the bathroom and closed the door.

Eva was enjoying her shower. When she suddenly felt like she had to pee again and badly. She tried to hold it in. But the sound of running water made it worse. Eva’s urethra felt weaker than normal. She felt pee about to come out and spread her legs wide.

Pee began to gush out full blast and down into the drain below. Eva had to hold onto the wall for support. When she finished she sighed. She felt tired and so did her bladder and urethra. She didn’t know if she would be able to hold it in if she had to go again.

Eva cleaned herself again with body wash and rinsed off. She got out of the shower and dried off with a towel. Putting on her new pajama shorts, tank top, and pink bra and panties. Eva opened the door and walked out. Maya was waiting.

“How was your shower?” Maya asked.

“Great except when I had to pee again and couldn’t hold it in. I peed in your shower, sorry.” Eva blushed.

Maya smiled “It’s okay. You look tired, do you want to sleepover and sleep together in my bed?”

“I’d like that.” Eva said.
