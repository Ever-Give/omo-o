Hi Everyone!

I'm somewhat new to posting to this site, but I've always been a good writer, and I'd like to write something that I, and everyone else can enjoy, so i'm asking for suggestions/ideas to write about, i know what i like but i think it would be fun to write about something I wouldn't usually think of, so all ideas welcome! I don't have too many experiences, (though I have posted one in the experience section), but it will be fun to write a little fiction ;)

I've been a long time lurker of this site, but i'm excited to finally become an active participant in the community
