I'll add tags later.

I want to point out that Piper Murphy – and all other characters mentioned in a sexual manner – are over the age of 18.

Piper Murphy sat in her seat, shifting uncomfortably as Principal Waters droned on and on about setting a good example to the Freshmen. Piper did not pay much attention as Principal Waters yapped about the worrying amounts of Seniors vaping in the school toilets. The only thing she paid attention to was the growing pressure in her abdomen from her rapidly filling bladder.

Piper needed to wake up at 4AM each day just to get to school and that meant lots of coffee to help her stay awake. But the journey was long – three hours on the bus – which meant that she would be full to burst by the time she got to school. And sometimes the bus itself would be late, meaning that she would have to hold back her urine until recess until she could scramble to a toilet and pee. But the Principal was using their recess to have her assembly and Piper was full to burst and she had to pee so badly that tears welled up in her eyes. She could not stop fidgeting lest she wet herself, soaking her jeans in front of the entire year... and her crush.

She stared at the clock. Ten minutes until Recess. She had English next. With Mr Greene. He was nice. He'd let her pee. Right?
