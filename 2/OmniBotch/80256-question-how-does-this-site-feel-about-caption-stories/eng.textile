Title

For those that don't know, a caption story is when you take an image (real or art, OC or someone else's) and on the side, you write an accompanying story next to it using some kind of editing software. I was wondering what this site thinks of them and if they're even allowed because I've only seen few instances and I don't know the current opinion of them. And If I were to do it, I'd be sure to have the source of the images with the caption story.

Also, there’s a relevant section about consent at the top of the Guidelines.

If you’re using a photo containing a real person you need their permission to use it.

I'll only be using art I find rather than real people, but that's good to know anyways. Thanks!
