It starts with a dragon waking up over many years and realising humans have built over the entrance of his home.

He needs to pee but humans keep coming over to ask him questions. He’s nice to them but wants to fly away to have some privacy. Eventually, a boulder/meteor falls and is about to crush the humans so the dragon catches it but the pressure causes him to wet himself. He then masturbates.

Details don’t match perfectly, but you may be thinking of ‘Urges of Ember the Dragoness’ by Leaky Bunnie and/or its fan-made continuation by OrionsBelt.

See if these links ring a bell:

Ahh the first one is it! Thank you for the help!
