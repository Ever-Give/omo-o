I already posted this in General however I think the story stands on it's own outside of a techdemo if it is a fopaux to do so just let me know. I added some sound effects inspired by @DuffMan and had to tweek some continuity error. and otherwise wrangling the ai. the story the reader every thing besides the sound effects are ai generated. the story is a fanfiction of the magicians I'm rereading it, ironically it was probably not the best choice in stories, as it is very melancholic and chatgtp doesn't do melancholic so the attempts to make them come off as affected and dower were either silly or didn't show up.

I'll also include the other one I made this one more abdl centric. which is the much shorter one.
