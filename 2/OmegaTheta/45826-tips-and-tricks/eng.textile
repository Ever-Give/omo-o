I have been an avid omorashi reader for the last year now, but only just found out about this site about 5 months ago. Suffice to say that there are many talented writers of omorashi out here. Now I myself have been working on writing my own fics (of which have yet to be in anyway posted) now for about a month now but I have hit a brick wall recently.

Issue 1: How does one 'pace' desperation? May seem like a silly question but I, for the love of me, cannot figure out how to pace the second phase of my stories. I always start out with dedicating the first half for a bit of world building but every time I get to the second half (where the 'desperation' of the story is supposed to be) I always make it too short or not enough references to the desperation. Is there any way to pace the story a bit? Do any of you guys, writers, have any tips for a newbie like I?

Issue 2: Motivation, it seems like when I write a story and get to the parts I had actually envisioned from the beginning I lose the confidence I had when originally writing it. Is there anyway to write out a story in a way that I can actually finish it feeling semi-motivated? Have any of you writers ever faced this?

I'd appreciate the help, thanks in advance to anyone who respond to this!
