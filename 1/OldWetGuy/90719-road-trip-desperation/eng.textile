You’re feeling the effects of over doing the coffee and ice water at breakfast. Your partner, Kathy, is obviously there too because she’s squeezing her thighs with her hand on her crotch. The sign says “Service Area 2 Miles”.

You exchange a “We got this” glance as you both concentrate on hold.

You start to exit left to the Service Area and are confronted by this sign, knowing it will be at least 30 more miles to the next available bathroom.

What happens next?

Feel free to add to the story.

“Kathy, reach under your seat and you’ll find two hospital chair pads and two towels. I think we better be sitting on those”.

I’m going to park over at the far end of the parking lot. Can you hold off a little longer? I’m already leaking. Give me the pad and towel so I can scoot them under my butt…..oh shit ! I’m pissing like a Firehose!!! Just give me the towel, my seat is already soaked!
