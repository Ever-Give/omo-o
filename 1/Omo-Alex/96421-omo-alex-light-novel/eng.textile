Omo Alex: Light Novel

Author: Omo Alex

*000*2024-01-01 02:17

Hi all, I‚Äôm starting to write a light novel based on my webcomic Omo Alex. I‚Äôm temporarily pausing the comic since I‚Äôve had very little free time with college and my job. I‚Äôm going down the light novel route since I have a lot of stories I want to tell, and I still want to draw the fun omorashi scenes. The light novel format isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve seen a lot of on this site, so I hope that I can make it catch on üôÇ Feel free to add feedback to this thread, this is my first time writing long format.

Chapter 0: The Road To College I was never a fan of school; I was constantly made fun of for my incontinence. My bladder leakage wasn‚Äôt anything excessive, but it did often leave a visible wet patch on my groin. Most girls in my position would wear pads or incontinence underwear to absorb the urine, but I grew up in a family that was dirt poor. We didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúthat kind of money‚Äù; most people in my rural town didn‚Äôt have much. Everything that I had was either donated or a hand-me-down.

&&

My only solace growing up was running and biking. In retrospect, running was a form of escapism for me. However, in the moment, I simply saw it as survival. My family had no car, and our trailer was well off the main road. The only way to get places was to run or bike.

After several failed attempts to get a job, I joined the cross-country team in high school to keep myself busy. At first, the bullying increased since my bladder leakage was the worst while I ran. However, after winning first place in several races, attitudes about me started to shift. I started making running friends, and a few classmates even consoled me about their own incontinence.

I never considered attending college. My grades were average at best and atrocious at worst. Above all else, I didn‚Äôt have the money or the credit to get a student loan. I assumed I would graduate and work in the Cobalt mine just like my father. To my amazement, after placing well in a few national races, I received a full-ride scholarship to a college called ‚ÄúOmo Tech.‚Äù Other than having a Division II cross-country team, very little is publicly known about this small university.

With only a bag of clothes and $23 in my wallet, I embarked on a journey to Omo Tech. My experiences at this eccentric school would forever change my life.

...

&&

Anxiety-riddled adrenaline got me through the first two days of classes. Classes were relatively easy, but the tight schedule and large campus made getting places on time challenging. To start, a five-mile forested trail separates the dorms from the academic side of campus. I enjoy running, so the morning commute never bothered me. The nail in the coffin was the five-minute break between classes. In just five minutes, you had to pack stuff and jet to another classroom which, was often in a different building.

I learned very quickly that finding time to take a piss is practically impossible.

&&

On the first day of classes, I held my pee the entire eight-hour school day-- which was only possible since I forgot to pack a water bottle and was severely dehydrated. Although, I did really need to pee by the time I returned to my dorm.

On the second day of classes, I desperately needed to pee by 6th period. I attempted to go to the bathroom between classes, but the line was out the door! OUT THE DOOR! There wasn‚Äôt a concert or anything inside the bathroom, lines for the restroom are apparently normal here. I turned around and went to my class immediately, but I was still late. I was swiftly slapped, spanked, and sternly told that I would need to attend weekend detention if I were late to another class.

By the end of the 8th period, my panties were sopping wet, and my leggings had a noticeable stain. No no, this wasn‚Äôt just my normal incontinence ‚Äúwet‚Äù, I accidentally squirted pee several times during class. In my defense, several classmates were also squirming in their chairs. Right after the class ended, I made a beeline for the bathroom and waited 20 minutes in line. I barely made it, but other‚Äôs in the line weren't so lucky.

&&

What happened on my third day of college I will never forget...

*002*2024-01-05 21:48

Chapter 1: Cross Fit Class To describe myself as ‚Äúdesperate to pee‚Äù would be a criminal understatement. By the end of the 8th period, I was ready to MURDER someone in order to use a toilet. The last time I peed was 6:00 AM, and it was now 4:00 PM. All my attempts to use the bathroom throughout the day were foiled by a lack of time, a lack of bathrooms, and stubborn professors.

Unlike my first two days of classes, today, I had a 9th-period fitness class scheduled for TWO HOURS. I ran past the bathroom on the way to the locker room, but to my avail, it already had a line. I had no choice but to get changed and go straight to class.

While getting changed, I heard a faint hissing sound from the adjacent row of lockers. I went over to investigate the noise but immediately regretted my decision. I stumbled upon my naked roommate Beth peeing on the floor.

I confronted Beth, and she said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame that there is always a line for the bathroom. If you were smart, you would get it over with and pee on the floor with me. Rumor has it that our new teacher is an ass who won‚Äôt let anyone leave the class.‚Äù

I stuttered and started to blush; blood pooling in my face made me dizzy. Beth had her legs spread wide open, pussy exposed, violently peeing on the floor like an untrained animal; yet, I was the one who felt embarrassed. What was with her nonchalant attitude? Could peeing on the floor really not phase her? I certainly never considered doing something like that. Well, could I? I certainly had to pee really, really bad... NO! Absolutely not; maybe if it were outside in the middle of a forest, but this was in the middle of a coed locker room!

After freezing and staring at Beth for 10 seconds, all I managed to mutter was, ‚ÄúBut, on the floor?‚Äù

Beth smirked and pushed out one last jet of pee, then leaned towards me, bouncing a little to drip dry. Beth started to stare at my visibly wet panties like a dog eyeing a treat it‚Äôs not supposed to eat. Beth remarked, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll eventually learn; besides, you are clearly leaking pee, and your bladder is bulging. I bet you won‚Äôt make it halfway through class.‚Äù

I quickly pulled my hands down to cover my groin and shuffled back to my locker. We both finished getting changed and ran off to class.

‚Ä¶

Our instructor, Liam, was a bit eccentric. When entering the cross-fit studio, Liam was at the front of the classroom shouting to himself while shadow boxing. On the white board he had written:

###

1: Give it Your ALLLL!

2: NOBODY leaves during class. NO exceptions

###

Beth was right; this new teacher would cause serious trouble for my bladder. I pensively looked around the room and sat beside Ben-- one of my other roommates.

After Liam reviewed the course syllabus, Ben timidly asked if the ‚Äúno leaving class policy‚Äù applied to bathroom breaks. Ben was fidgeting where he sat; it was clear that he also needed to pee. Liam responded in a horrifying booming voice: ‚ÄúDid I stutter?! I said no exceptions! That obviously includes bathroom breaks! Anyone who leaves class or stops working out will immediately fail!‚Äù

Silence quickly fell over the fitness studio, and a palpable tension started building. It felt as if we were teleported into a low-budget horror movie as the gullible teenage victims. Liam slowly glared at each of us with murderous intent and shouted: ‚ÄúClass is in session. We'll start with 40 push-ups!‚Äù

Liam drilled us into the depths of hell until we became zombies. Fear and anxiety reanimated our muscles and pushed them past their human limits. The cross-fit studio was cramped, muggy, and reeked of body odor. We were all sweating like dogs trying to keep pace with Liam‚Äôs insane workout regimen.

This class was a death trap for people with incontinence; the non-stop jumping jacks, squats, and crunches would have been enough to make me soak my shorts on an empty bladder. With each passing round of exercises, I could feel a little pee dribble past my labia and absorb into my cotton panties. I was sure that I was starting to form a noticeable stain on my workout leggings, but I refused to look down out of fear of how large the wet patch had gotten. How embarrassing! Other than Beth, I don‚Äôt think anyone at this new school has seen my incontinence yet.

Nerveless, I couldn‚Äôt let my workout leakage distract me from my main problem. My bladder was throbbing; every motion sent a shock wave of pain throughout my body. It took all my strength to prevent myself from losing control. I crossed my legs and grabbed my groin every chance I got to give myself an ounce of relief. But, nerveless, opportunities to cross my legs were few and far between since Liam gave us no breaks between exercises.

Whoever created CrossFit was definitely a sadist!

...

After enduring one hour of torturous training, we were given a quick break as Liam explained our next exercise. To my horror, we would attempt a team formation where we would all be stacked on each other. Liam drew the positions on the board, and I was on the top of this pyramid since I was the ‚Äúlightest.‚Äù I started feeling woozy, and I quickly zoned out. Wetting myself in this scenario would be a life sentence of humiliation. I‚Äôve been worried this whole time about having an accident on the gym floor, but to be stacked on top of my classmates‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶you know...ummm‚Ä¶.

When I snapped back, Liam was hoisting me up by the waist and stacking me on top of Ben in our ‚ÄúAero Yoga‚Äù formation. Beth and Jack were at the base of our formation with their feet in the air, supporting Ben‚Äôs back. Ben was lying down with his feet and hands in the air, supporting me. I was in a push-up formation with Ben‚Äôs feet on my waist and our hands locked together.

The second Liam dropped me into the formation, my bladder started crying with pain. There were three main problems with this formation:

Ben‚Äôs feet were pressing the edges of my bladder.

The core strength required to maintain this position put additional pressure on my bladder.

Our formation wasn‚Äôt very stable, and to stop our swaying motions, we had to flex our muscles ‚Äì which put irregular pressure on my bladder.

Liam wanted us to hold this formation for five minutes. But the pain was far too great; I‚Äôd never felt anything like this before. Thirty seconds in, pee erupted out my urethra, quickly flooding my panties. Pee started dripping down onto Ben. I frantically flexed my leaky bladder in an attempt to stop myself from drenching my classmates. In the process, I made a really embarrassing noise that could simultaneously be described as moaning, crying and whimpering. I regained control, but I could tell that this wouldn‚Äôt last very long; the dam was broken, and all I was doing now was preventing the inevitable tidal wave. The uncontrollable urge to pee was now pelting me like cold raindrops.

With tears starting to pool in my eyes, I cried: ‚ÄúPlease, can we get down? I‚Äôm starting to wet myself!‚Äù

Ben chimed in: ‚ÄúCoach, I also really need to pee and I don‚Äôt think I can hold it much longer in this position.‚Äù

Liam took a deep breath and shouted:‚Äú I don‚Äôt give a hoot or a holler if you wet yourself! You little shits are already staying after class to clean the entire studio. You know what? Let‚Äôs restart the clock and do ten minutes! Glory doesn‚Äôt come without pain, sacrifice, and devotion. If we don‚Äôt exercise with everything we have, what meaning can our pitiful lives ever have! So be it if you must get a little wet to find salvation and glory. THE GYM IS MY CHURCH, AND THIS IS YOUR BAPTISM!‚Äù

Glory? Baptism? I had no clue what the hell our instructor was storming on about, but I knew for sure that my fate was sealed. I just had to play my cards and hope I‚Äôm not bullied too severely..... AHHHHHHHHHHH NOT THIS AGAIN. My heartbeat skyrocketed as my mind went a million miles an hour. Painful memories from high school flooded my thoughts: the nicknames, rumors, humiliating photos, graffiti with my name, and the taunting. Tears started rolling down my face. I can‚Äôt handle being called ‚Äúpissy pants girl‚Äù again. I just can‚Äôt.

Through my teary eyes, I looked down and made eye contact with Ben. I immediately recognized that he was experiencing the same pain I was having. He didn‚Äôt just need to pee; his pipe was about to burst. A wave of zen rolled over me-- we were both in the same boat. Everything was going to be okay. I realized that this college was nothing like my high school; the people here wouldn‚Äôt make fun of me for my incontinence or for having a wetting accident. Everyone around me also hasn‚Äôt used the bathroom all day. This school was crazy.

Without warning, Beth sneezed. ‚ÄúAaaaa AAAAA chew!!‚Äù This sent a shockwave through our formation, which made us sway back and forth. While regaining balance, Ben‚Äôs foot landed right on my bladder. A violent, uncontrollable jet of pee rocketed out my pussy, crashed against my panties, and continued onward, spraying pee downwards in all directions.

Ben started wetting himself shortly after I started. I looked down once I noticed another hissing noise, and I saw a stream of pee flowing across Ben‚Äôs stomach, making his shirt wet. Our pee combined and rained downwards, hitting the floor and splattering against Beth and Jack.

Jack was the last one to start wetting themselves, and once they did, their pee jetted out between their legs and hit Beth. Jack never told anyone during class that they needed to pee, but after they started peeing, I could see by the look on their face that a great deal of pressure was lifted.

I tried to stop peeing, but I couldn‚Äôt. My bladder was ultimately out of strength after holding an enormous amount of urine for eleven hours. Not to mention, Ben‚Äôs foot was still pressing against my bladder, ensuring that I would dribble every last drop out.

While the three of us peed, I experienced unadulterated tranquility. All day, my mind was a thunderstorm of anxiety, growing larger and larger the more as I had to pee. But eventually, the floodgates opened, and now all my worries were flowing out. My bladder discharging felt heavenly, the warm pee rolling down my groin felt sensual, and the sound of pee dripping was calming. The three of us peed for a solid four minutes, and I savored every second.

I had never prayed before; I didn‚Äôt even know who I was praying to. Maybe Liam was right, and this was our baptism. Maybe there are forces in this universe we don‚Äôt understand. Maybe I‚Äôm too young to understand‚Ä¶ but surely, this was a miracle. I prayed that this moment of pure bliss would happen again.

Chapter 1.5: The Shower Room &&

After we cleaned the cross-fit studio, we hit the ‚Äúcoed showers.‚Äù However, around here, people just call them the ‚Äúshowers.‚Äù Everything at this college is coed; nothing is segregated by gender-- this shocked me when I first arrived. I grew up in a curmudgeonly conservative town where there were precisely two bathrooms, two locker rooms, and you were dead if you were ever caught going into the ‚Äúopposite‚Äù gender‚Äôs.

If my father knew that I had a male roommate, or that I was taking a coed communal shower, he would have a heart attack. Hell, if I had known that one week ago, I may have had a heart attack myself. It‚Äôs not that I have anything against coed facilities, it‚Äôs just that I have never seen another person naked before, let alone a person of the opposite sex.

Having coed facilities are considered standard in this area. During orientation, I learned that Ben and Beth went to boarding schools with similar coed policies. They never seemed phased by changing in the middle of the dorm room, and they certainly didn‚Äôt hesitate before getting naked and entering the shower. I, on the other hand, timidly covered myself with a blanket while changing in our dorm, and I was more than reluctant to get fully naked for this shower. I tried entering the shower wearing my underwear, but Beth lunged at me and said, ‚ÄúYou gotta clean yourself down there!‚Äù Needless to say, Beth won that argument-- it‚Äôs hard to win an argument against someone as high-strung as her.

&&

Initially, the three of us were silently showering. I was grateful for the silence-- we could avoid eye contact that way. We were just independently bathing ourselves, scrubbing away all the sweat and piss that had clung to us during class. Maybe this isn‚Äôt as awkward as I initially thought; there is nothing intimate about showering next to someone. We are all roommates; hell, we just peed on each other; we are practically family now. There is no reason why showering together would be weird. Right? Showering is strictly platonic, but still, my eyes can‚Äôt ignore Ben‚Äôs alien thing swinging around...

Breaking the silence, Ben said, ‚ÄúCrazy class, am I right?‚Äù

Sarcastically, I responded, ‚ÄúYeah, I still smell like pee despite using a load of soap.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou freshmen really are hopeless!‚Äù Beth interjected in a condescending voice.

Ben defensively snapped, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt patronize us, Beth!‚Äù

Beth smirked and continued, ‚ÄúOh please, It‚Äôs the third day of classes. You two should have caught on by now.‚Äù

‚ÄúCaught onto what?‚Äù I inquired.

"For 2000 students, there is only one bathroom on the academic side of campus." Beth coyly remarked.

Considering the line, I knew there weren't many bathrooms, but I always assumed there were others. The only bathroom I knew of had 4 stalls and 4 urinals; no way that serviced 2,000 students. Is she crazy? Certainly, that can't be right. Regardless, we were talking about the smell of pee...

I retorted: ‚ÄúOK, but how does that relate to us smelling like pee?‚Äù

Beth tapped me on the head and said, ‚ÄúThink dum dum‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt smell. It‚Äôs the shower room that smells. It‚Äôs practically a urinal during the day.‚Äù

‚ÄúHaha, just because we are freshmen, don‚Äôt expect us to believe something that ridiculous. Where are all the people peeing if this is pee pee palace?‚Äù Ben replied.

‚ÄúPSssH, I‚Äôll pee right here!‚Äù Beth barked. Without a second notice, Beth pulled up her left leg and started peeing shotgun style, shooting scattered pee drops toward us both.

I jumped back and yelled, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pee on us, Beth! I already washed my legs! Besides, peeing here doesn‚Äôt prove your point!‚Äù

While continuing to pee, Beth responded: ‚ÄúAfter staying late to clean your pee puddle in the gym, it‚Äôs probably past 9 PM. Nobody but freaks are left on campus.‚Äù

As if Beth‚Äôs words held magic, the shower room door bursted open, and a short redhead girl barged in. She walked up to us, squatted down, and started peeing. She put two fingers on her clit, and started aiming her pee towards the floor drain. In an energetic voice, she said, ‚ÄúHey Beth!! Who are these two snacks you got with you?‚Äù

&&

In a low, deflated voice, Beth responded, ‚ÄúAri, these are my two roommates, Ben and Alex.‚Äù

Snacks? What the hell is up with this girl? Why does she have a creepy smile? Why is she peeing right next to us? Maybe it‚Äôs one thing if she knew us all... no, that‚Äôs crazy. Even if Beth was right and everyone peed in this room, surely you wouldn‚Äôt pee right next to someone while the rest of the room was empty. There must be some sort of etiquette around this. There was something unusual about Ari.

Ari must have noticed my shock and said: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the faces? Did I do something?‚Äù

Before I could think of a coy response, Beth replied: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about them; they just aren‚Äôt ‚Äòpotty trained‚Äô yet.‚Äù

Ben immediately cried: ‚ÄúPotty Trained? Hold up! Aren‚Äôt there laws requiring enough bathrooms in schools so‚Ä¶ you know we don‚Äôt pee on each other during class?‚Äù

While still peeing into the floor drain, Ari looked up and responded, ‚ÄúWell, local laws around here are pretty lax. Our college is complaint since the law considers the entire property, not individual buildings. Since the entire campus includes the dorms, academic buildings, and campsites, the students per toilet ratio falls within legal limits.‚Äù

I responded, ‚ÄúHuh, even so, that feels weird.‚Äù

Ari continued, ‚ÄúBefore the Great War, this was a military college that taught leadership and engineering. It‚Äôs rumored that every detail of the school‚Äôs design was intentionally plotted by a sadistic drill sergeant obsessed with running. His theory was that if you had to pee, you had a motive to run faster. That‚Äôs why the dorms and the academic side of campus are separated by five miles. If you want to make it all day without wetting yourself, you must get fast at running five miles. Since then, Omo Tech has been turned into a private college, but many of the military fitness practices and schedules persist.‚Äù

Ben shouted again: ‚ÄúPotty Trained!?‚Äù

Beth smirked and said, ‚ÄúStudents fall into one of four groups: Wetters, Pissers, Diapers, and Holders. Most students start in the holder category since they naively hold their pee until they make it to a restroom or have an accident. Students without superhuman bladders will eventually have accidents, pushing them to join another group. People in the wetters group intentionally wet themselves in convenient locations to avoid an unplanned accident. Girls in the wetter category often wear skirts, allowing them to covertly wet themselves between classes while just getting their panties wet. Students in the pisser group find creative non-bathroom locations where they can pee throughout the day-- like this shower room. People in the diaper group wear diapers to avoid all the fuss; however, with all the running required at this college, not many people wear diapers.‚Äù

&&

My mind glazed over with shock as all the mystery pieces about the college fell together. However, I was hung up on the four student groups. I‚Äôll admit, holding and having an accident today felt sensual and made me tingle in all the right places, but the lead-up to it was dreadful, and it was really embarrassing. Regardless, all the other groups presented by Beth sound just as awkward! Really... students wet themselves here? I also couldn‚Äôt imagine peeing in public. I‚Äôve peed in the forest, but that‚Äôs different; this is a college campus. Diapers? No way, they are too bulky to run with, and I could never afford a new pair each day. Since I can‚Äôt choose between the four groups, I guess that makes me a holder? Who knows, maybe this is a false dichotomy. My bladder might adapt.

Ari finished peeing, stood up, and said: ‚ÄúY'all freshmen will figure it out soon enough. Anyways, Beth, do you wanna hang out tonight?‚Äù

Dismissively, Beth said: ‚ÄúOh, errrmm umm, tonight, yeah, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

Ari gave Beth a devious smirk and said, ‚ÄúI scored some booze off some upperclassmen.‚Äù

Beth‚Äôs face immediately lit up, and she yelled, ‚ÄúHell yeah, let‚Äôs have a party in my dorm tonight!‚Äù

*009*2024-01-26 19:15

&&

After making the five-mile trek back to the dorms, it was 10 PM, and I needed to pee again. I debated swinging by the bathroom, but my stomach cried louder than my bladder, so I stayed with my roommates as we ate pizza and mixed drinks. I believe that ‚Äúhunger is the best spice.‚Äù although we were chowing down on dollar store pizza after not eating anything since 11:00 AM, this pizza tasted like a five-star meal.

After trying a beer that tasted like sewage in high school, I swore that I would never drink alcohol. Nerveless, after a little ‚Äòpeer pressure,‚Äô I caved in and tried alcohol for the second time. Ari mixed rum and cola, and Beth mixed vodka with orange juice. After trying both, I was shocked at how good alcohol could taste. While eating, we each had a drink with two shots of liquor and 10 oz of either cola or orange juice.

After we devoured the entire pizza, Ari pulled out a deck of cards and said: ‚ÄúTime for a drinking game!‚Äù

&&

I responded: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the game? I‚Äôm no good at cards.‚Äù

Ari looked at Beth, grinned, and continued: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a simple game of truth or dare. You draw a card from the deck, and you have to do what the card says. If you skip the card, you drink.‚Äù

Ben leaned forward and asked: ‚ÄúHow do you win?‚Äù

‚ÄúEach card is worth a certain amount of points and is ranked A-D. Higher ranking cards are worth more points but are more challenging.‚Äù

&&

Ben asked, ‚ÄúWhat does the winner get?‚Äù

Ari started responding but, Beth quickly cut her off and said: ‚ÄúThe person in last place will have to do the winner‚Äôs laundry the entire semester.‚Äù

Before any of us could object, Ari exclaimed: ‚ÄúAlex you go first!‚Äù

Beth drew a card from the deck and placed it before me.

&&

I blushed and reluctantly started telling a story: ‚ÄúTwo weeks ago, I competed in a 120-mile bike race. I was running late the morning of the race, so I skipped the bathroom, figuring I would pee on the five-hour train ride to the race‚Äôs location. However, rather than a long-distance train with a bathroom in the back, I got on a commuter train without any toilets!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was a hot summer day, and this was an important race, so I drank water on the train ride to stay hydrated. I figured there would be bathrooms at the race‚Äôs location. With my luck, the line for the bathroom was unfathomably long. This isn‚Äôt uncommon for races: race locations are often overcrowded without enough bathrooms at the park. This race had over five thousand competing students! The stinger was that this race was televised, and the park was crawling with spectators. Most of the other students just peed outside, but I couldn‚Äôt, not with that many people watching.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter the race started, my bladder anguished for 20 miles before it retaliated and let out a hot jet of pee. But, the thing with peeing while cycling is that leg movement swiftly clenches any pee desperately trying to escape. I could have stopped peddling to let out more pee, but this was a competitive race. Losing 30 seconds would have been devastating.‚Äù

&&

‚ÄúAfter my first partial accident, I stopped trying to hold it. Or, more accurately, my bladder had lost its strength, and I couldn‚Äôt hold it anymore. Every five to ten miles, when my bladder hit a tipping point, another gush of pee would escape and run down my legs.‚Äù

Beth interjected: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen bike races before. Doesn‚Äôt the peloton pull over in a group, and everyone pees on the side of the road?‚Äù

I snapped: ‚ÄúMaybe in a men‚Äôs race! But female races are typically shorter, so the peloton doesn‚Äôt take breaks like that. Even if we did, it‚Äôs not like I would pull down my pants and pee on the side of a road lined with spectators.‚Äù

‚ÄúBesides, the peloton leader decides if the group takes a break. The peloton leader that day was fierce and led an aggressive pace. She was not taking any breaks! In fact, she wet herself! And let me tell you, this wasn‚Äôt a quick squirt like me. While leading the pack uphill, she sprayed everyone behind her for a solid minute! Maybe that was her secret tactic to winning the race: use her urine like a Mario Cart attack to splash people away from her.‚Äù

‚ÄúBefore you say it, Yes, there are bathrooms along the race route but, a bathroom break would take at least 2 minutes, and if there is a line, you could forget about catching up to the peloton.‚Äù

I scanned the dorm and continued onto the most embarrassing part: ‚ÄúPeddling was the only thing keeping my exhausted bladder clenched. Right once I crossed the finish line and stopped peddling, pee started gushing out. While I slowly glided my bike to a halt, pee showered down and left a noticeable pee trail behind me. The worst part was seeing all the heads turn towards me and hearing all the cameras clicking.‚Äù

&&

Ari jumped up and yelled, ‚ÄúI knew I recognized you from somewhere! You were all over the internet forms!‚Äù

I cried, ‚ÄúHuh, what! Where?‚Äù

Ari responded, ‚ÄúOh, errr, umm, never-mind. Ben, your turn!‚Äù

&&

Ben drew dare card C-01, which required him to drink. Beth handed Ben a red solo cup filled with orange juice and one shot of vodka. Beth pulled dare card B-11, requiring her to remove her pants. Beth eagerly ripped off her leggings, looked at the three of us, and sat down with her legs spread apart-- a bold position considering that she had a visible camel toe. Ari drew truth card D-02, which asked her: ‚ÄúWhere do you pee when the toilets are all occupied?‚Äù

This piqued my interest, and I asked: ‚ÄúYeah, where do you pee at school during the day?‚Äù

Ari started: ‚ÄúAs you know, the average wait time for a toilet on campus is around 25 minutes. If I enter the restroom, I usually pee in the sink. But, there is often a line for the sink as well.‚Äù

&&

‚ÄúThere are several floor drains throughout the school that have become popular pee places. Once the freshmen catch on, there are always a few students peeing at the same time there. Without stall restrictions, floor drains can accommodate quite a few people at once. I‚Äôll aim my piss directly into the floor drain, but others just pee in the general proximity of the drain. In the scheme of things, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you aim: everything around a floor drain is tiled and sloped towards the center, so the pee never pools.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm... there are also some lockers with pee buckets.‚Äù

Ben cried: ‚ÄúPEE BUCKETS?‚Äù

Ari nonchalantly explained: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something the garden club started. Some members converted their lockers into ‚Äòrecycle stations‚Äô where they collect pee using buckets with wide openings. The pee is transported to the garden club and mixed with compost. The urine helps break down the compost and adds nutrients to the soil.‚Äù

&&

Beth chimed in: ‚ÄúJust remember, when peeing outside of the bathroom, you gotta be careful not to get caught ‚Äòindecent.‚Äô Punishment from the administrators can get pretty cruel. For this reason, many students wet themselves in these locations instead. You can wet your leggings while crouching over a floor drain, but the second you pull your underwear down, you are in a world of hurt if you get caught.‚Äù

Ari rolled her eyes and said: ‚ÄúPsh, those are just rumors made up to scare underclassmen. Faculty never ‚Äòpatrols‚Äô the halls; I have yet to meet a student who was punished for taking a piss with their panties pulled down.‚Äù

Beth snapped: ‚ÄúYeah, well, what about what happened to us last semester!!‚Äù

Ari snapped back: ‚ÄúThat was totally different! You were completely naked, drunkenly running around the dorms, peeing on people‚Äôs doors. Obviously, you got punished for that. I‚Äôm just talking about respectful students peeing between classes!‚Äù

Ben jumped up and said: ‚ÄúI think I see where this game is going. I‚Äôm going to run to the bathroom.‚Äù Ben tried to open the door, but It didn‚Äôt budge. Ben cried: ‚ÄúAm I crazy, or is the door locked from the outside?‚Äù My heart sank; I also really needed to pee. The drinks were starting to catch up, and I could now feel the pressure on my bladder building.

While Ben continued to fumble with the door handle, I noticed a note by his feet and shouted: ‚ÄúLook! There is a note under the door.‚Äù

The note said: ‚ÄúBETH! You little shit!! I know you are drinking again. I‚Äôll unlock your door in the morning. My reputation can‚Äôt afford an incident like we had last year. -- Your RA‚Äù

Beth defensively said: ‚ÄúPsh, It wasn‚Äôt that big of an ‚Äòincident‚Äô; I didn‚Äôt even pee on their door!‚Äù

Ben air quoted: ‚ÄúSmall ‚Äòincident,‚Äô yeah, I bet.‚Äù Ben and I looked at each other, and we giggled. Ever since our shared wetting accident during cross-fit, the chemistry between us has sparked. We constantly exchanged glances, and talking didn‚Äôt feel awkward ‚Äì a significant accomplishment as an introvert. Once again, we both needed to pee and this time, we were locked in the dorm room together... How far will this game of truth or dare take us?

I timidly asked: ‚ÄúWhat do we do now that we are locked in? I also need to wee.‚Äù

Ari grinned and said: ‚ÄúWe finish the game silly! That‚Äôs what! These drinks aren‚Äôt going to drink themselves!‚Äù

Beth yelled: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to win that laundry service!‚Äù

Ari flipped a card from a different deck, placed it in the middle of the room, and explained: ‚ÄúAt the end of each cycle, a group card is played. These are either zero-point group dares or cards won by a single person in a competition.‚Äù

&&

A holding competition! Ari and Beth clearly had an unfair advantage since they last peed in the shower room around 8:30 PM, whereas Ben and I last peed during class around 6:30 PM. Around 10 PM, we started drinking caffeinated soda, alcohol, and orange juice-- three things that make you need to pee right away. I wonder if Ari planned this from the start?

Beth yelled: ‚ÄúAlex, it‚Äôs your turn! The group card is done while we continue playing individual cards.‚Äù Beth flipped another card and gave it to me.

&&

My face immediately turned red. Showing my dirty underwear would be rather embarrassing‚Ä¶

I stuttered, ‚ÄúUmmm, hmm, do I have to?‚Äù

Ari leaned towards me, eyeing the hamper under my bed, and said, ‚ÄúIf you pass on a card, you lose the card‚Äôs designated amount of points, and you have to down a 12 oz drink.‚Äù

This was a tricky decision. On the one hand, an extra drink would surely make me wet myself first, but on the other, my panties are really dirty. Not just dirty with fresh pee but dirty with permanent stains caused by incontinence and discharge. However, I‚Äôm pretty sure they noticed my stained panties in the locker room earlier; this may offer me a chance to explain my situation.

Sheepishly, I said: ‚ÄúWell, OK. I‚Äôll dig out my panties from the hamper, just don‚Äôt take any photos.‚Äù

&&

Ari crawled over to me and dove her nose down as if she were about to sniff my blue panties; instinctively, I pushed her face away. Ari cried: ‚ÄúAww, Alex, you're no fun! These pee stains are impressive; they are obviously more than a few months old. Even students who frequently wet themselves here don‚Äôt form stains like this in their first semester. How did you get them?!‚Äù

Timidly, I said: ‚ÄúI do a lot of running, and when I go for a run, I get slightly incontinent. I don‚Äôt wet myself completely, but it does dampen my groin. Over time, it builds up and stains my underwear.‚Äù

Admittedly, this was a bit of a white lie. I do leak a lot more while I run, but regular activity is often enough for me to leak throughout the day. It‚Äôs the 24/7 dribble that is constantly drying that forms the permanent stains.

Beth looked at me and said: ‚ÄúYou should wear diapers.‚Äù

Defensibly, I responded: ‚ÄúNo way! I could never run wearing diapers.‚Äù

&&

Ari turned to me, saying: ‚ÄúI agree, DO NOT GET DIAPERS. Don‚Äôt listen to her, Alex! I know a place where you can sell these panties and make a killing! Stains that don‚Äôt wash out sell 10x what lightly worn panties sell for.‚Äù

Ari kept staring at my panties; you could see that gears were turning in her head as she plotted something. I started to realize why Beth was hesitant to hang out with her. Ari is crazy! Who just insists that someone sell their panties? I‚Äôm not that type of person. But, hypothetically, if I sold my old stained panties, I could afford a new set. Then, I might be less embarrassed to get changed around others‚Ä¶

Beth drew a card and handed it to Ben.

&&

Ben‚Äôs gaze turned from my panties to me, and then he zoned out while smiling. I felt a chill run down my spine and a tingling sensation between my legs. Noticing that my vagina was starting to get wet, I blushed and looked away. I knew showing my underwear was a mistake! It got Ari excited, but now Ben? Was Ben fantasizing about my panties, or maybe it was the mention of my incontinence? I don‚Äôt know why, but the thought of Ben getting aroused by my incontinence made me crazy horny. I crossed my legs, ensuring nobody would notice if my leggings also got wet...

After calling Ben‚Äôs name a few times, Beth slapped Ben on the face and said: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your pee fantasy?‚Äù

Ben stuttered and said: ‚ÄúOh, um, badly needing to pee while swimming.‚Äù

Ari shouted: ‚ÄúLAME! What is your actual fantasy? Don‚Äôt lie this time!‚Äù

Ben blushed, paused momentarily, and replied: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it, I swear! I love peeing in a cold pool; the feeling of a warm pee jet running down your legs, seeing the yellow plume of piss that slowly gets diluted to nothing, swimming through a warm patch of water, and trying to figure out who just peed.‚Äù

Beth sighed and drew a card for herself, glanced at it, and flipped it around so we could see it.

&&

Beth said: ‚ÄúThis card is easy. My favorite place to pee is the garden club; they let students pee anywhere in their massive garden!‚Äù

Ari yelled: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just peeing outside!‚Äù

Defensively, Beth said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not ‚Äòjust peeing outside‚Äô; it‚Äôs giving plants the nutrients required to flourish and grow vegetables. Peeing in the garden gives my piss meaning!‚Äù

Ari rolled her eyes and drew a card for herself.

&&

Ari grinned and said: ‚ÄúLucky me! I get to pee a little while not changing my status in the holding contest.‚Äù Ari stood in the middle of the dorm and pulled her short shorts down. Ari then locked eyes with me and slowly pulled her panties down. Ari pointed to the stain on the crotch of her panties and said: ‚ÄúSee this, Alex, I‚Äôve worn these nearly every day the last four months, and I finally formed a fair stain. Despite being nothing compared to yours, this pair will sell for $70.‚Äù My jaw dropped, $70!

Ari gently used her fingers to spread her labia open, moaned, and let out two one-second spurts of pee. Pee went flying onto the floor in front of her, and a little pee splattered on her thighs and shorts. Ari slowly pulled up her panties, using them as a wipe to dry her legs. Ari then rubbed her pussy through her now half-wet panties, grinned, and said, ‚ÄúI feel much better now.‚Äù

Beth drew a group card and placed it on the floor.

&&

We mixed drinks, set a timer, and sat on the floor to exchange stories. Everyone got two 12 oz red solos to finish in the half hour. Ari and Beth downed their drinks quickly, but Ben and I took time sipping them. I was now starting to feel the effects of the alcohol; I wasn‚Äôt drunk, but I was definitely tipsy.

I tried to listen as everyone told stories, but my bladder was now bulging. All my attention was focused on finding the most comfortable sitting position. I also experimented with the best way to hold your groin to alleviate pressure. Wherever I tried, it didn‚Äôt work very long. I came to the conclusion that squirming a little while changing hand positions worked the best.

Ben told us about where he used to pee when his boarding school roommates occupied the bathroom. I couldn‚Äôt listen to that story; men have it much easier finding places to pee than females do. UGH, OK, you just peed in a water bottle! Great, if I tried that, I would make a mess everywhere.

Ari and Beth told us about how they got in trouble as freshmen. While listening, I tried to determine the plausibility of their stories. I‚Äôve seen nearly a dozen wetting accidents in my first three days of school, yet I still feel like I must take everything they say with a grain of salt. Everything about this school still sounds absurd to me.

By the time we had five minutes left on the timer, I had only finished one of my red solo cups. With Ari and Beth cheering me on, I downed my second drink and immediately felt the weight of my stomach pushing down on my bladder.

During cross-fit class, needing to pee felt painful. But now, the sensation felt good. Really good. Rousing? The alcohol was making me feel warm and tingly all over. But there was something else. Maybe it was that I was getting aroused by the way Ben glanced at me every time that I squirmed my legs. Or perhaps, the bladder pressure was adding to my horniness.

Once the timer went off, Ari snatched a card from the deck and placed it in front of me.

&&

I got up and started doing pushups. I immediately recognized the difficulty of this card. Not only did I have to pee really bad, but all my muscles were extremely sore from our cross-fit class earlier, and I was dizzy from the alcohol. After doing each pushup, Beth judged it and decided if I had to redo it due to ‚Äúpoor form.‚Äù However slow, I managed to do 20 pushups.

Planking was even more difficult since I had to hold the plank for a continuous minute. About thirty seconds into the plank, my stomach muscle twitched, and a gush of pee rushed out my pussy, and a few drops hit the floor. Immediately, Beth shouted: ‚ÄúLook, Alex is wetting herself!‚Äù

Defensively, I said: ‚ÄúNo, no, that doesn‚Äôt count as an accident!‚Äù

After I finished planking, everyone came over to me and examined whether this counted as an ‚Äúincontinent incident‚Äù or if I actually wet myself and was disqualified from the holding contest.

&&

Ari remarked: ‚ÄúOnly Alex‚Äôs pussy is wet; I deduce that less than half a second of pee was released; this is clearly not an accident!‚Äù

Ben concurred: ‚ÄúThis definitely doesn‚Äôt count as ‚Äòpeeing‚Äô‚Äù

Beth disagreed, but she was outnumbered, so I was safe.

Ari nudged me and said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting to think you get incontinent more than just when you go for a run.‚Äù Ari then flipped over a card and handed it to Ben.

&&

Ben looked around and said: ‚ÄúThe worst bathroom I ever used was at the summer camp where I worked. The bathroom was always empty since it was in a secluded area. It was a coed bathroom with five toilet stalls. This bathroom was filthy; I‚Äôm sure it was never cleaned. There was toilet paper on the ground, used condoms, feminine hygiene wrappers, etc. Every surface was stained with dirt or piss. The bathroom also had terrible lighting, making everything look even dirtier. As a result, I avoided the bathroom and peed outside every chance that I had.‚Äù

I turned to Ben and said: ‚ÄúI think I can picture that. When running cross country, the park bathrooms were always super dirty. Nobody on the team wanted to use them, but they were our only option. Well, some people peed outside, but as a girl, I try to avoid doing that.‚Äù

Ari grinned and said: ‚ÄúPSH, a dirty bathroom is no big deal. It‚Äôs not like you ever touch the toilet. Just hover over it and spray!‚Äù

I blushed and said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never done that.‚Äù

Ari grinned and said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you how someday.‚Äù Ari then drew a card and handed it to Beth.

&&

As Beth stood up, Ari said: ‚ÄúBeth, are you really going to drop out of the holding contest?‚Äù

Beth responded: ‚ÄúI may not look it, but I badly need to pee. I‚Äôm not sure I can hold out any longer if I drink more. I‚Äôm playing it safe by doing this card.‚Äù

Beth got into her bed, knelt down. I heard a hissing noise, and then, half a second later, a jet of pee started flying out of her blue panties, showering down onto her bed sheets. Out of the edges of her panties, pee was dribbling down and running along her thighs.

Out of curiosity, I asked: ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you worried about the mattress?‚Äù

While peeing, Beth responded: ‚ÄúThe mattresses are 100% waterproof vinyl. While you wash your sheets, you can clean the mattress with a damp towel. The biggest pain is the bed sheets; they stain easily.‚Äù

I immediately saw what Beth was talking about. Her pee wasn‚Äôt absorbing into the mattress at all. Beth was kneeling in a puddle of pee that had formed above her bed sheets. After peeing for a solid minute, Beth got off the bed and returned to sit with us.

Ari drew a card and started diabolically laughing.

&&

Ari looked at Ben and I and said: ‚ÄúI dare you two to have a tickling contest. You can only stop when one of you wets yourself.‚Äù

I looked at Ben, and he smiled and said, ‚ÄúSure, let's do this.‚Äù I could see that Ben needed to pee pretty badly from his posture and how he talked about needing to pee earlier. However, I probably needed to pee even worse than Ben. I didn‚Äôt know how much longer I could hold it... Ben locked eyes with me and nodded; his gaze told me he desperately wanted to tickle me. This gave me a rush of horny excitement. Reluctantly, I said, ‚ÄúOK, I‚Äôll do this dare.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know if I was ticklish, but I quickly found out that was the case. Ben immediately lunged towards me, pinned me on my back, and started tickling my exposed belly. I immediately started laughing. My entire body was shaking. Ben‚Äôs warm hands running up and down my stomach, tickling me, got me excited and tingly all over. My nipples got rock hard, and my pussy started getting even more wet. As Ben continued to tickle me, I started shaking, and then a squirt of pee flew into my already-soaked panties.

I couldn‚Äôt hold this position much longer; I needed to go on the offensive. I used my feet to push Ben off of me, and then I sat up and slid my hands up under Ben‚Äôs shirt and started tickling his stomach. Finding his ticklish spot was hard, but he eventually started laughing.

Unexpectedly, Ben used a wrestling move, which maneuvered him directly behind me with his chest pressed against my back while I remained sitting. Ben used his legs to pin my thighs against the floor. I tried to reach my hands behind to tickle him, but he grabbed both my arms and used one of his hands to pin both my arms against my back. Ben used his free hand to start tickling me.

&&

Ben tickled my stomach, my legs, and then my feet. I learned that I‚Äôm the most ticklish at the bottom of my feet. When Ben discovered this weakness, he took full advantage and sent me into a hysterical laughing frenzy. My entire body was shaking in an orgasmic laughing fit. I started gushing pee out in high-velocity squirts that lasted several seconds each. After squirting several times, Ben slid me up onto his lap. Ben then started tickling my stomach and thighs with both hands. This made me laugh even harder, and I started peeing while shaking without realizing it. After I realized I was peeing, there was little I could do to stop it. Pee was slowly dribbling out and trickling onto Ben‚Äôs lap. Ben paid no attention to the splashing pee and all the noises I was making and instead doubled down and tickled me even harder. Each pulsation of my body sent more pee outwards. It was as if my bladder muscle was deactivated, and Ben was now shaking all the pee out of my body.

When my bladder was about half way empty, I felt a hot jet of pee hit my groin from behind: Ben had started peeing. I turned around to look at Ben, and he discretely winked at me. I quickly picked up on his plan: Ben had purposefully positioned me onto his lap so that my pee would shield his own accident. Before I had a second to react, Ben started tickling both my feet, which made me go crazy again. While laughing hysterically, I was practically grinding on Ben‚Äôs lap while his pee jet massaged my aroused peeing pussy. This gave me a new feeling of ecstasy that I have never experienced before. We both finished peeing about twenty seconds later. Or maybe Ben just forced himself to stop peeing after I stopped leaking pee on his lap. Regardless, my bladder was now empty, and I felt like I just had an orgasm.

At this point, our dorm room floor was covered with pee, Ben and I were soaked, and we were panting like dogs. Ari came over and said, ‚ÄúBravo, you two little love birds gave quite a show! Looks like Ben won!‚Äù

I rolled off Ben and we both stood up and blushed. Ben shouted: ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt lovers! This was just a.. a competitive tickling contest.‚Äù I though of something to say, but words slipped my mind. I was still fixated on the stirring sensation within my vagina.

Ari looked down at Ben and said: ‚ÄúYour little guy says differently.‚Äù I turned around to look, but Ben quickly covered himself with a red solo cup.

Before Ben could respond, Beth said: ‚ÄúI guess that just leaves the holding competition between Ari and Ben.‚Äù Beth walked up to Ben and Ari and sucker-punched them both in the stomach simultaneously.

Ben jumped back and said: ‚ÄúOuch, Beth, what was that for?‚Äù

Ari, on the other hand, fell down to the floor. Shortly after, you could hear a loud hissing noise. Ari was wetting herself! Ari cried: ‚ÄúNo fair Beth, I could have lasted at least thirty more minutes!!‚Äù

Beth responded: ‚ÄúI want to actually get some sleep tonight. Let‚Äôs tally the points, but it looks like Ben won.‚Äù

&&

Shortly after tallying the points, we all slept on the floor. Beth‚Äôs bed was wet from her dare earlier, and Ari was a guest, so she didn‚Äôt have a bed to sleep in. We all decided to sleep on the floor in the name of equality. Plus, after whispering to Ben, we both thought it was too risky to sleep in our beds while needing to pee.

On the floor, I was sandwiched between Ari and Ben. Ari was a restless sleeper who constantly tossed and turned; Ben made soft snoring noises while he slept. After eventually falling asleep, I was woken up by Ben having an accident. Ben must have rolled over earlier since he was right beside me, putting me in his ‚Äúpuddle zone.‚Äù I quickly went back to sleep, appreciating the warmth of his pee.

The second time I woke up, I felt pee streaming out my pussy and rolling sideways down my ass and thighs, adding to the puddle between Ben and myself. I didn‚Äôt even notice that I needed to pee that bad, but I guess alcohol makes me a bed wetter! Rather than stopping it, I continued to pee since we were still locked in the dorm with nowhere to go. While continuing to pee, Ben moaned and rolled in closer towards me. I could feel Ben‚Äôs breath down my neck; we were practically spooning-- except we didn‚Äôt have our arms locked. We probably got this close to each other by accident, but it still made me horny. We were sleeping right next to each other, laying in each other‚Äôs pee.

When I woke up the following day, I noticed that Ari had also wet herself in the middle of the night. Ari was lodged tightly against me, with her legs strewn over my own. I rolled over Ben, shook him awake, and we got ready for class. Today was the freshmen induction ceremony.
