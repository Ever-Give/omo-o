Hi guys!

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in reading the full Harry Potter series but with accidents and a character with an omorashi fetish

It wouldn't be on every page, but there would be subtle things every few pages. Let me know!

Btw... if you have any suggestions about plot points including omo, tell me!

I have decided I really am going to do this, and you can help me. If you have any idea for a situation in which I can add omo things, please let me know. I want to make clear a few things:

- I will have to use the American book, as much as I would like to use the British version, as it's the only free online version I can find.

- In the first chapter, I will only be able to change one tiny tiny thing, but I promise, the following chapters will be much much better. As far as I know, you don't even need to read the first chapter if you know it already.

- I will start by posting the first 2 or 3 chapters tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, because of the previous point.

- I will strive to post one chapter a day after that, but I probably will skip a few days once in a while.

- As soon as I have published the first chapters, I will post a link to it in this topic, so you don't have to go looking for it yourself.

I hope you guys enjoy it! Bye!
