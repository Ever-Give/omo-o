Part 1 of ? (Not sure how many parts there will be, but I do already have the ending in mind)

It was just another day like any other. Classmates Naoto Shirogane and Rise Kujikawa were made to be partners on a project for one of their classes. It wasn’t anything too complicated as they were simply tasked with making anything they would deem “creative,” but the problem is that neither of them ever did stuff like this. Naoto is a detective, so she’s more about solving than creating, and Rise is an ex-idol with creating songs needing a wholly different set of skills than creating something physical. This lead to the both of them waiting until the last day before they had to turn in their project tomorrow with zero progress made.

Then, after school, Rise came up with an idea. The shadows of the TV world drop a bunch of weird and abstract materials, so if they were to kill a few and put those materials together, they’d definitely be able to come up with something interesting, right? And if they just go to Yukiko’s Castle, a place with the weakest shadows, they’d be able to just head in without having to drag their friends into the mess and get started asap! With one day left to go, Rise grabbed Naoto’s hand and dragged her to the TV world, not knowing Naoto’s embarrassing predicament.

“Alright, so here’s the plan,” said Rise. “You’ll do a simple in and out of the castle and destroy and shadows on your path while also collecting anything they drop. I’ll watch over you from the entrance in case you happen to run into any problems. At most, you might need a couple of heals. So, sounds like a plan, right Naoto-chan? …Naoto-chan?”

Naoto, dressed in a schoolgirl’s uniform after encouragement from her friends, was silent and looking down. Unbeknownst to her friend, Naoto didn’t have a chance to pee all day. The detective had overslept and had to run to school, was held up in conversations with her senpais in between classes, and was dragged into the TV world by Rise before having a chance to use one of the Junes restrooms. Even worse is that Naoto was introduced to a new trend of “Think Drinks” by her classmates and had drunk 5 cans today trying to brainstorm a way to complete her and Rise’s project. Had she known Rise would be the one to come up with the plan, she never would have added more pressure to her bladder.

“Hey, earth to Naoto,” said Rise. “Are you there?”

“Huh!?” said Naoto, being brought back to reality. “Oh, yes. Sorry, I was just… thinking of what we could make with the shadow materials. I, uh, think I have a few ideas already.”

Naoto couldn’t bring herself to tell her friend that she had to badly pee. If they left the TV world now, it would be difficult to sneak back in without drawing suspicion and the TV world doesn’t have any bathrooms in it, meaning that Naoto had to hold it for the entire trip.

“Well, we can worry about that part later,” said Rise. Shadows come in all shapes and sizes and there’s no telling what they’ll drop. So let’s get this show on the road!”

“Er… Yes, lets!”

With that, Naoto quickly sprinted into the castle, trying her best to hide her “potty run” from Rise.

Now on the castle’s first floor, Naoto pulls out her gun and gets into position to fire.

“This feels a bit better.” Naoto thinks to herself, “Deep breaths. Deeeep breaths. If I can just focus on the mission at hand, it should hopefully take my mind off my bladder. Now all I need to do if find a… shadow!”

A few feet in front of her was a shadow, and a weak one at that. She took a second to steady herself, take aim, and *BLAM*! The shadow was obliterated, but at a cost.

“Gah!” Naoto said to herself as a sharp pain was felt at her bladder. Naoto’s gun was strong, too strong. So much so that the recoil put her off balance and caused a minor leak at her panties, making her put her hands on her crotch and do a potty dance.

“God dammit!” yelled Naoto. “I’ve been holding it all day and I won’t be able to work like this! I have to let it out now before I soak myself!”

The young detective proceeded to undo her skirt and pulled her panties down in seconds. She lifted up her shirt, as to not get it wet, revealing a bulge at her stomach from holding in a day’s worth of piss. The young detective was ready to squat down and let out a violent downpour on the castle’s carpets to relieve herself when suddenly-

“Naoto, stop! What are you doing!?” Rise screamed over the communication channel.

“R-Rise?” Naoto stammered, forgetting that her friend was watching her.

“Are you trying to pee in the middle of the floor!? You can’t do that! It’s so unprofessional!”

“I don’t care! I haven’t had a chance to relieve myself all day and I need to let it out now before I end up wetting myself. I don't care if I’m seen as ‘unprofessional,’ I need to do this, now!”

Naoto prepared herself, ready to let out a torrential rain of her piss. At this moment, nothing mattered other than relief. She was going to stain the carpets of this castle with a pool of yellow liquid if it was the last thing she did!

…

…

…

Or so she thought.

“It’s not coming out!” Naoto exclaimed. “Why isn’t it coming out!?”

“Phew.” Said Rise. “ That was a close one. I guess you’re one of those people that can’t pee in front of others no matter how hard you try.”

“Rise, please,” Naoto said, practically on the verge of tears. “Just cut off the communication and let me pee. I feel like my bladder is going to explode.”

“As if! For all I know, if you do this once, it will become a habit of yours. I’m gonna use Kanzeon to make a hologram of me to ‘walk’ with you. Any time you think about peeing, you’ll have me watching over you!”

“Rise, you can’t be serious. You’re practically torturing me here. You can’t possibly expect me to kill shadows while holding this all in. Especially with my gun messing up my bladder.”

“No way! You’re forbidden from peeing in the TV world! Just hold it until we get back to Junes. The bathrooms are literally one isle away from the electronics area.”

“That still doesn’t fix my gun problem.”

“Hmm… Oh, I know! Why not use your persona? Yamato-Takeru has light magic, so use that to instantly kill shadows with a Mahamaon.”

“I-I can try. Persona!”

Naoto, now having pulled up her panties and skirt, agrees to try Rise’s plan and summons Yamato-Takeru. Casting a Mahamaon, she wipes out all the shadows on the current floor!

“See? Wasn’t that easy?” said Rise?

“It looks like it.” Naoto said with relief in her voice. “My persona did all the work, so there wasn’t any strain on my bladder.”

“Awesome! Now it’s time to collect everything they dropped for our project. Only 7 more floors to go!”

“S-seven!?”

This is both my first ever pee-based fanfiction and my first piece of fiction on this site. I'd love to read any read any feedback given because it was fun writing this first part! And I am sorry if the tags spoil the ending of the story. I don't think I can edit them later, so I just have them in advance.

The second and final part of this story. I had a blast writing this and I hope you do, too!

“Persona!” Naoto screamed once again, annihilating all the shadows in her path.

“Amazing!” Rise cheered. “Six floors of shadows up and gone! You’ve done a good job of removing the shadows, Naoto-chan, and holding it all in.”

*huff* *huff* “You say that like it’s a good thing.”

Naoto’s expression changed in the last six floors of the castle. Her face now blushed and her breathing now heavy from holding it in for so long. It was made even worse that she had to take mandatory fifteen-minute breaks after each floor so Rise could raise Naoto’s spirit so she could cast more spells, forcing the young detective to hold in her piss for even longer. Naoto wanted to do nothing more than to just let it all out, but as long as her friend was watching over her, she had no hope of letting out a drop due to the embarrassment of being watched.

“Rise,” Naoto said doing a potty dance, “I think we have enough materials for the project and I’m ready to leave. I can feel the bulge in my stomach swelling up even more and I worry this will cause problems for me in the future.”

“Fair enough.” Rise complied. “You’ve been doing the heavy lifting while I just stand outside and slowly restore your spirit. Just let me warp you out and then I can- Naoto, get down!”

“What is it!?”

The young detective slid behind a corner of the castle walls and was now on her butt. It put even more strain on her bladder moving so hastily, but it was something she had to do for her safety. What could be behind that corner? Did a powerful shadow migrate to the castle? Did the reaper decide to leave its chest?

“It’s a golden shadow!” Rise whispered with excitement.

“Ugh…” Naoto remarked, having put unnecessary stress on herself. “That’s what’s so important? It’s not even that powerful and will just run away.”

“Exactly! If it runs away to the eighth floor, we’ll never get it.”

“And why should I prioritize that shadow over a toilet?”

“Because if we get a golden material from it, we’re practically guaranteed a passing grade on our project! Even if what we make totally sucks, some semi-real gold will definitely be enough to make it beautiful.”

Naoto then let in a deep breath and then a deep exhale. She was frustrated about her current situation, but deep in her, she knew Rise was right. Both of their creative skills were terrible, so a golden material would push their grade up. …Only there was one problem.

“Rise,” said Naoto, “I can’t possibly kill that shadow the way I am now. I’ve already ran out of spirit, so I can’t cast anymore spells. And in the time it takes you to refill it, the golden shadow could come my way and see me.”

“Yeah, you can,” said Rise. “Remember, drinks raise spirit in the TV world. If you drink something, you’ll surely be able to have enough for another spell cast!”

“Well, unfortunately, I didn’t bring anything with me. Normally, senpai handles our inventory so I guess you just need to warp me out of here so I can pee, right? …Right?”

Rise’s hologram stood there, silently staring at the desperate detective. She had a slight grin on her face, and that’s when Naoto knew her bladder was in for more punishment. Naoto then saw a small flash of light as an item was warped next to her, causing her face to turn white.

“Ta-da!” Rise said as if she were presenting a prize. “It’s a Jumbo Juice! 1200 milliliters of fresh juice that’s sure to raise your spirit enough for a spell or two!”

Naoto stared at the bottle of juice with disbelief. If she didn’t know any better, she would have sworn that Rise was playing a sick joke on her. Rise knew that Naoto’s bladder was under so much pressure already and now, she wanted even more added on. Naoto wanted to resist, but she knew Rise was a great persuader and trying to resist would only waste time.

“…Rise,” Naoto said reluctantly, “I’ll drink the Jumbo Juice, but you have to promise that you will do something for nce I kill that shadow.”

“Whatever you want, Naoto-chan!” Rise said with a cheery voice. “Like I said, you’ve been doing the heavy lifting, so I owe you big time.”

“Glad we could come to an agreement. Now then…”

Naoto once again turn her head towards the Jumbo Juice and started working a plan in her head. Drink the juice, cast a Mahamaon, collect the gold material, and get to a Junes toilet before the juice made it to her bladder. It sounded easier said than done, but she had to try. The young detective, with each leg wobbling as they moved, got back on her feet with the juice in hand. She wanted to take a second to get her thoughts together, but another problem arose.

“Naoto,” Rise whispered, “The shadow is coming this way!”

The golden shadow was now scurrying in their direction. Should it see Naoto, it would surely escape as Naoto was in no position to give chase.

Naoto, now scurrying to get the top off the Jumbo Juice, took seconds to steel herself, and lifted the bottle towards her mouth!

*gulp*

*gulp*

*gulp*

*gulp*

*gulp*

Naoto was downing the juice as fast as she could while Rise watched with excitement, pumping her fists and mouthing the words “Chug, chug, chug, chug!” Tears were nearly forming at her eyes with each swallow as she felt that this was a bad idea already. Her bladder couldn’t fit any more liquid inside of her, but she didn’t have any other options other than forcing herself to make it fit. That gold shadow had to go or else she would never hear the end of it. After about 20 seconds of drinking, she managed to finish in time

“God… dammit.” Naoto said to herself. “Never again.”

The young detective was struggling to keep her balance. 1200 milliliters added on to her already filled bladder. If it weren’t for Rise, Naoto surely would have given in, but she had a mission to complete.

“Naoto!” Rise loudly whispered. “The shadow’s closing in! You have to cast a spell, now!”

Naoto cleared her mind and took aim at the golden shadow. It did its best to turn around and run, but Naoto wasn’t going to let that happen.

“Persona!” Naoto screamed, summoning Yamato-Takeru and casting one last Mahamaon. From the bright light, a bed of sever thousand yen and some gold scraps were seen. Naoto closed in on the pile, and collected her spoils.

“Fantastic!” Rise screamed extatically. “Naoto, you have no idea how much you’ve saved us! Now I can warp you out and you can get your relief.”

“Then do it!” Naoto commanded. “I feel like my bladder’s about to crack open!”

Naoto was now the most agitated she had ever been in her life, and rightfully so due to her pain. While she was often attacked by shadows, she at least had healing spells to rely on to fix anything that was wrong. But healing spells can’t fix a bound bladder. The only thing that can fix it is the relief of letting it all out, and she was being denied that by her friend. All she could do is do a potty dance and gently rub her stomach as to distract her from the pain.

“Okay, okay, I get it,” Rise replied. “I’ll warp you back to the castle entrance. From there, we can walk back-”

“RUN!”

“Run back to the studio and we can enter the TV there to get back to Junes. Like I said, the bathrooms are right next to the electronics area, so you won’t have to wait long. Okay, here we go!”

And in an instant, Naoto was warped back to the castle entrance and next to Rise.

“Here!” Naoto said as she shoved the bag of shadow contents into Rise’s hands. “I’m going to run ahead to the studio, I can’t wait another second!”

And run she did. Naoto sprinted with her hands in between her crotch towards the studio. Relief was finally in her grasp as it was just a straight path from the castle to the studio. She could already envision a free toilet, ready to take in a day’s worth of her stress.

“Hey, wait up!” Rise called out, giving chase to her friend.

*5 minutes later, the duo closed in on the studio, ready to enter the TV back to Junes*

“Finally!” Naoto cheered to herself, ready to crawl into the TV. “Finally, I can get this all out of me. I just need to get into TV and then I can-”

“Hold it!” Rise screamed.

Naoto flinched. What now? They beat the shadows, got the materials, and were now back at the studio. What could possibly be holding her back this time?

“We need to check to see if anyone is outside,” said Rise. “Remember, even if the electronics area is often empty, we never know is someone’s going to be looking directly at the TV we exit. Let me peak my head out so I can check”

Naoto groaned, frustrated to be denied her relief once again. She wanted to be even more upset, but she couldn’t get mad. No one’s ever at the electronics area because everything is too expensive for the country people of Inaba. She would be at a toilet in no time-

“There’s a news outlet in there,” said Rise. “Apparently they’re interviewing workers and they chose to be right in front of the TVs.”

“…Are you serious!” Naoto screamed.

Why? Why now of all times? It was as if the entire world was out to get her. Denied her relief at home, at school, and in the shadow world multiple times! Naoto was now past a potty dance and was now stomping and hopping about the studio. The entirety of the Jumbo Juice made its way to her bladder and she knew her time was up.

“Naoto-chan, calm down!” Rise said, trying to comfort her friend.

“No!” Naoto blared. “I’ve been holding in pee all day and then thanks to you, I had to add even more stress to my body. I’m going to let this all out, even if you have to watch!”

Naoto then started to undo her skirt while hopping in place. Even if she had to go, she’d be damned if she actually wet herself. Within a few seconds, she got the skirt off and threw it to the side, revealing her stained, white panties with little droplets dripping from them.

“Naoto!” Rise screamed. “You can’t do that here! I forbid you!”

But Naoto wasn’t listening. She had worked hard today and she was determined to get her reward. If she couldn’t get to a toilet, then she was just going to have the studio be one for her!

“Naoto!” Rise screamed again, positioning herself next to Naoto in hopes of spooking her friend into holding it all in, but Naoto was resolved.

Naoto still didn’t listen as she quickly removed her panties from herself. One leg. And then the next, reveling a bare ass and a soggy tuft of hair at her pussy. Like her skirt, she threw it to her side and of her and out of the way, only Rise caught it, causing her to blush. Naoto quickly lifted up her shirt, reveling a large, round bulge on her stomach caused her by bladder, and squatted down and was ready to unleash her wrath on the studio floor.

“Naoto, please!” Rise screamed once more… but it was too late.

“Haaaaaah~!”

PSSSSSSHHHHH

Naoto began to unleash a tsunami of piss onto studio floor, her head pointed toward the sky as the golden liquid made its way out of her. It came out with such force that it seemed as if Naoto was power washing the floor with it. As the piss came out, Naoto made an O-face as if she were having an orgasm, and with the way she was talking, it might as well had been one.

5 seconds pass

“Aaaaaahn~”

10 seconds

“Yeahhhhh…”

15 seconds

“Yes… God, yes!”

20 seconds

“Ooooohhh~”

25 seconds

“Mmmmm~”

30 seconds

“I needed this…”

35 seconds

“Hah~… Hah~…”

After 40 seconds, Naoto’s violent storm of pee finally came to a stop as she had looked down to see what she had created. A puddle so large that if it weren’t for the bright yellow color, you would have sworn was caused by a broken pipe. Naoto looked with her puddle with a smile and sense of accomplishment as she managed to relieve herself before ruining her clothes. She rubbed her stomach, satisfied that the giant bulge had finally left. Rise, however, looked at the puddle with horror, wondering of it was normal for a schoolgirl to be able to hold so much liquid within her.

Naoto then stood up and looked at Rise.

“Rise-chan,” Naoto said, snapping her fingers to get her attention. “My panties?”

“Huh? Oh, right.” Rise said, now brought back to her senses. “Here you go.”

Rise handed Naoto her panties, which were still dry enough to be worn without causing suspicion, and slid them back on.

“…So, Naoto-chan,” said Rise “You’re not mad at me for what I did today, are you?”

“Huh? Oh, not at all,” Naoto said, getting her skirt back on. “In a way it was kind of exciting. Just promise me that you’ll buy me some new, cute panties and do the majority of the project work, and I’ll let today slide.”

“Thanks, Naoto-chan, you’re the best! I think the news outlet is gone now, so I’ll go on ahead. Meet me at my place?”

“Yeah, I’ll meet you there once I get myself together here.”

Rise then smiled at Naoto and crawled through a TV screen ahead of her. Naoto had gotten her skirt back on and was ready to follow, but looked at the large puddle behind her. Staring at her for a good few seconds, she couldn’t help but ask herself:

“…I wonder if senpai would be into this?”

I absolutely loved writing this story! It's my first one dealing with Omo and I feel like I had a good understanding of it.

Once again, I'd appreciate any and all fedback from those who made it here. I'm genuinely excited to know what you thought of it!

I really liked the dynamic! It made it seem like it's a Naoto/Rise/P4Protag ship, with Rise seeming like she's enjoying Naoto's desperation. I was hoping she wouldn't make it, but I really liked this and I hope you do more!

Thanks for the comment! Rise might not have planned it, but she sure awakened something within Naoto! I do plan to write some more for Omo Org at some point as I have a few more ideas with original characters (one ENF and the other with a female knight) that will come at a later point. And now that I read your comment more, it's given me an idea for a sequel for this story, so, again, I very much appreciate the comment!
