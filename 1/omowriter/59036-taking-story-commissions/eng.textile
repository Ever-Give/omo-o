Hi All,

I'm a long-time lingerer on the forums but this is my first time posting. I'm a writer by trade and, after reading dozens of inspiringly crafted stories on this site, I'd like to finally try my hand at producing them myself.

What you can expect from my stories:

- Serious attention to detail and imagery

- Clear and aesthetically pleasing writing style

- Flexibility with subject matter, POV, length and writing style

- High concern with your own satisfaction and making sure to produce the exact content you desire to read.

- Reasonable and flexible rates.

Please feel to DM with about any specifics, and I'd be happy to open a dialogue with you. I apologize for the lack of info on my account itself, I'm still getting accustomed to Forum culture.

Happy wetting!
