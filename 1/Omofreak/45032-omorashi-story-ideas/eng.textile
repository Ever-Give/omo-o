So I've been brainstorming a few scenarios that would make great omorashi stories. I suck at writing short stories though. If any story writers or comic artists here need inspiration here are some free prompts.

Long road trip, every rest stop has a closed bathroom or is hundreds of miles away. Each gas station bathroom has a line of people waiting or is out of order. Some teen is in line at Tana-con (Search it on youtube if you don't know what it is) and is desperate to pee. The line won't move for another three hours, there are no available bathrooms and they can't get out of line. Character in mariokart is in the middle of a long race near a body of water and is about to burst. Futanari campers on a hike desperately needing to pee, but keep drinking water. Victorian women in crinoline dresses that need to pee but they're in the middle of a long banquet. Guys having a pissing competition in the snow. Students have to hold their pee all class period in order to pass the final exam.
