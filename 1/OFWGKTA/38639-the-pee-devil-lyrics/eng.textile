So I'm an aspiring rapper and song writer. I like to write rap lyrics and make a little story out of it. I decided to write this little piece, because I thought it was really cool. Plus I just wanted to express my talent. Feedback is really helpful btw:

I found my first victim of the day,

Courtney didn’t hesitate,

Downing her Starbucks, because she was rushing to catch a plane

She would soon need to find a nasty nest to lay,

Wearing a tank top, skinny jeans, and some shiny boots,

A pretty face to recognize,

With velvet hair, emerald eyes, and a sexy body that guys could jeopardize,

Before walking out the door, Courtney had to pee,

Deciding if she should go or not,

It wasn’t urgent, but enough to feel like her bladder was leaching,

I sat on her left shoulder, the pee devil they call me,

Your friend that makes you cancel your trip to the potty,

Luckily she was a little bit naughty, so she shrugged her right shoulder and went out the door,

Thinking she can hold it till she got to the airport,

I fiddled my fingers, carrying a sinister grin like Joker,

5 minutes while standing at the cross walk, Courtney’s bladder was quickly increasing,

And her knees started wiggling,

The street sign changes, reminding her bladder like a river,

If only her bladder had a lever,

But a nice build up would make it so much better,

Having seconds thoughts, she looked back,

Regretted chugging all that coffee, Cause now she has to pee so bad,

But the devil on her shoulder told her to keep it moving,

As I was keen on carrying on the mission,

15 minutes later, 15 minutes to go,

A warm golden stream just ready to flow,

But Courtney held on like tug a war in the cold,

If only her jeans weren’t so tight,

Then her bladder wouldn’t bite,

But that didn’t mean she wasn’t ready for a fight,

She was tempted to pee in public,

But there was too many people she couldn’t bear to risk it,

And her flight was in 20 minutes, she didn’t wanna miss it,

Every step felt like jumping over broken bridges,

So awful she was on the verge of peeing in her britches,

And the pee devil chuckled knowing he was about complete his mission

At last, the airport was in sight,

Her eyes gleamed with subtle relief, but that didn’t mean it was over,

At this point she ignored both shoulders, mind keen on the goal,

Boots ponding on the concrete like a gavel when it knocks,

10 minutes left on the clock she picked up the pace,

Her heart racing, momentum shaking, her legs stopped so she can catch her breath,

Having to pee so bad she prevented her pants from being put to death,

I couldn’t help, but to cross my fingers,

Although she was close to losing it I didn't take it for granted,

As she reached the entrance I knew my mission was hopeless wishing dreams,

Till she started getting the jitter bees, I knew she was frantic,

You could tell her mind was panicked, because she was getting close to the bathroom,

Up the escalator, and down the hall, a heavenly light shone onto the bathroom door,

With a sign that said Restrooms, Courtney never thought something so nasty would look so glamourous,

Like God answered her prayer, till she saw an old lady inching towards it, making Courtney's heart pound,

Even though she gathered attention, Courtney sprinted through the crowd,

Trying to make it first so she can make her childhood proud,

But things don’t always go as planned, the poor girl left locked out of the bathroom door,

With no choice but to wait, Courtney danced, her thighs shaking loudly,

Still she clung onto her crotch like she was catching big fish,

Mind clouded with anxiety she knew she wasn’t about to get rich,

At least not with this gold,

Soon her vagina would shoot like a pisstol,

Her jeans left drenched in muggy yellow,

She whimpered like a puppy stranded in the ghetto, with her legs crossed tightly,

She was a helpless little girl, Mind going blank it was like balancing on jello,

A tear escaped her eye, gripping the crotch of her jeans, you knew she was screaming for help,

And suddenly, the fight gives up its memento,

Dance dance furiously, and then the river says hello,

I laughed, watch as urine rises up the poor girls ass,

Slithering down her legs with a stench of sewer and mildew,

In order to form a puddle, that boots couldn't catch,

There were plenty of other fish in the sea for the pee devil to hail storm,

As another victim passes by his eyes moved on,

Leaving Courtney to sulk in her soaked pee pants
