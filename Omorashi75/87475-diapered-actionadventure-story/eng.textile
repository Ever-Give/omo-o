Hi all,

I've been thinking about this for a while and I'm thinking that I might write an action adventure story with a diapered protagonist. Think John Wick in diapers. The character will have a genetic disorder requiring diapers that is widespread, so diapers aren't abnormal in this universe. People in my own life say I'm very good at action scenes so I though I'd give it a try.

I could even do a scene where the protagonist gets ambushed while changing, kind of like that scene in John Wick 3 where John has to assemble the revolver, but instead is a diaper change. It won't be anatomically graphic though. I want to keep it PG 13.

I'll let you know what I come up with.
