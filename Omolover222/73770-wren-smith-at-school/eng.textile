Remember Wren Smith? From my first ever omorashi fiction. Well they have now made a reprise.

Wren’s school did not have a gender neutral bathroom. Consequently, Wren would try to hold in their pee as long as they could.

Usually the female ones as Wren was AFAB and needed to sit down, and the male ones only had a limited number of stalls. They were also scared of being beaten up.

It was 3rd period now, and it was a hot day. Wren was beginning to feel a small twinge in their bladder. Nothing they weren’t used to. You don’t hold it in for 7 hours every day without getting a few strong bladder muscles.

But as the day progressed Wren found it was harder to hold…
