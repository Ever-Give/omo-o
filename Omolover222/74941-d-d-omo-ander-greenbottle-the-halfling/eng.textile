Also I am relatively new to D&D.

Ander Greenbottle had just turned 20. He was an adult now, at least that’s how the Halflings saw it. And I guess you guys too.

Ander was drinking from a large water swing. In hindsight, he’d perhaps should’ve been sparing with his water. After all, this mountain road was dangerous and a Halfling like himself would only have a few precious spaces to pee safely.

Much less than the other species, who would be semi-desperate by the time they got to the safe point. And this path was well traveled, there would’ve been a line, but Ander was too existed to control his drinking.

Ander had started a good pace, when he first felt the need, but fortunately for him, there was an outcrop designed as a toilet right there. And since no one was about-

He undid his belt and his cloth and pulled down his white pants and his tight trunks. It revealed an above average dick for a Halfling. Sighing with relief, he peed and quenched his thirst again, unknowing of the pressure he’d have to endure…

Ander had been walking for a while and his bladder had gotten full. Not uncomfortably full, but Ander was rather well known for his weak bladder. At school he’d occupied a bathroom often and had suffered accidents frequently.
